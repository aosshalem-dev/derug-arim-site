# Deep Research: מרקם — Markam

## Executive Summary / Thesis

**CRITICAL FINDING: "מרקם" in the Gefen catalog is NOT the well-known "מרקם - רשת הקהילות המעורבות" (Mixed Communities Network).**

The Gefen program #31655 "המרחב החברתי - כיכר אתרים (סיור פני האדם)" is listed under a supplier called "מרקם" — but the actual program is operated by **"המרחב החברתי" (The Social Space)**, whose legal entity is **"למרחב לשינוי חברתי" (ע"ר) — registration 580354538**. The Gefen contact is **Omer Kinnan** (054-6783432), and the CEO is **Keren Labia** (née Greengrass).

There is a **separate, unrelated entity** called "מרקם - רשת הקהילות המעורבות" (580541910) — a religious-secular coexistence network founded by Gesher and Tzav Piyus. And a **third entity** called "מרקם חברתי" (580672350) in Yaffa, focused on legal education in schools.

The exact legal relationship between the Gefen supplier name "מרקם" and these entities requires further clarification. Below, all three are documented.

### The Building's History
- The Colosseum building at Kikar Atarim was a notorious **strip club ("הפוסיקט")** that opened in **2012**
- It was closed in **2019** after the JTLV real estate company (led by **Amir Biram, Ariel Roter**, and investor **Shalom Fisher**) purchased the property and refused to renew the lease
- JTLV donated the building to "המרחב החברתי" for use as a social center
- **All profits** from the Social Space are directed toward funding professional training courses for **women survivors of prostitution, sexual violence, and economic abuse**

## 3. LEADERSHIP

### המרחב החברתי (The Social Space) — Entity B
| Role | Name |
|------|------|
| **CEO / Director** | **Keren Labia** (קרן לביא) — also identified as Keren Greengrass on LinkedIn |
| **Board Chair** | **Yakir Shagev** (יקיר שגב) |
| **Board Members** | Mirav Shlitine, Ariel Schwarzberg, Sharon Ben Shem Gorin, Nitay Alush Even, Theodore Landau, Vered Ulfiner, **Eyal Biram** |
| **Sales VP / Contact** | **Omer Kinnan** (עומר קינן) — Gefen contact, age 28 (as of search date), employed since 2022 |

**Note on Eyal Biram:** The surname Biram also appears in the JTLV company (Amir Biram) that donated the building. This may indicate a family/business connection between the real estate donors and the board.

### Omer Kinnan — NIF/Shatil Connection
Dr. Omer Kinnan (a different person from the VP — same name) is featured on **Shatil** (NIF's action arm) website as a researcher on social struggles in the digital age. He is a lecturer at **Sapir Academic College** and **Bar-Ilan University**, specializing in digital activism, Ethiopian-Israeli protest movements, and civil society. **This appears to be a different person** from the Gefen contact (a 28-year-old VP), but the name overlap is notable.

**Source:** https://shatil.org.il/testimonials/%D7%93%D7%A8-%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8-%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F

## 4. FINANCES

### Entity B (למרחב לשינוי חברתי — the Gefen operator)
- **2024 Revenue: NIS 3,370,629** — 4.6x the sector median (NIS 739,442)
- **Government funding: NIS 162,896** (4.8% of revenue) — from Ministry of Welfare for at-risk youth
- **Remaining ~95% is non-governmental** — likely from:
  - Real estate company donations (buildings)
  - Gefen program fees (NIS 44,453 from this one program x multiple programs)
  - Tour ticket sales (public tours via Funzing, toMix, etc.)
  - Crowdfunding ("Rising from the Ruins" campaign)
  - Potential philanthropic donors (not publicly disclosed)

### Entity A (מרקם - רשת הקהילות המעורבות)
- **2023 Revenue: NIS 2,033,716** — 2.7x sector median
- **Government funding: NONE** in last 3 years
- **Revenue sources:** Likely from parent organizations (Gesher, Tzav Piyus) and philanthropic donors

### Entity C (מרקם חברתי)
- **2024 Revenue: NIS 177,343** — below sector median
- **Government funding: NONE**
- Tiny operation (2 employees, 0 volunteers)

---

## 5. IDEOLOGY: "Mixed Communities" — What Does It Mean?

### Entity A (the original מרקם)
**"Mixed communities" means religious-secular Jewish coexistence** — NOT Jewish-Arab. This is specifically about religious (dati) and secular (hiloni) Jews choosing to live together in the same neighborhoods, share community institutions, and create a joint Jewish lifestyle.

The movement emerged from **Gesher** (a religious-secular bridge organization) and **Tzav Piyus** (reconciliation initiative). Founded after tensions around religious-secular divides in Israeli society. Over **20 communities** across Israel participate.

**Connected to:** Neemanei Torah VeAvodah (Religious Zionist moderate movement), MAKOM (national council of mission-driven communities), Meitarim network.

### Entity B (The Social Space / Gefen program)
The ideology is **gender justice, anti-trafficking, feminist activism**. The program uses the former strip club as a pedagogical tool — the building itself becomes evidence of exploitation. Students experience what the space felt like and then process the moral implications.

**Key ideological claims:**
- Education for "healthy sexuality" (מיניות בריאה)
- Anti-prostitution / anti-trafficking perspective
- Gender equality advocacy
- Social responsibility and "involved citizenship"

### Entity C (מרקם חברתי)
Social equality via legal education workshops in schools. Minimal ideological footprint.

---

## 6. FOREIGN FUNDING

### Direct Evidence Found: NONE
- No NIF grants to any of the three entities were found in search results
- No EU funding documented
- No Abraham Fund connection
- Not listed in NGO Monitor's foreign funding database
- No evidence of foreign donors to Entity B or Entity A

### Indirect Connections
- **Shatil (NIF's action arm)** features Dr. Omer Kinnan (a researcher, likely different from the Gefen contact) on their testimonials page — this is a **weak connection** (he endorses their blog, not necessarily a grantee)
- **Gesher** (parent org of Entity A) has historically received funding from various sources including some foreign philanthropic foundations, but no specific foreign government funding documented for מרקם itself
- **עמותת תודעה** (Toda'a NGO) appears to run workshops at the Social Space, but the nature of this relationship (partnership? tenant? client?) is unclear

### Assessment
The Gefen program itself costs only NIS 44,453 and is funded through the Ministry of Education's Gefen framework (school budgets). The operating entity (Entity B) has NIS 3.37M revenue with only NIS 163K from government — the remaining ~NIS 3.2M is from non-governmental sources that are not publicly itemized. **This is a transparency gap**: a 3.37M operation with 95% private funding and no public donor list.

## 7. NETWORK CONNECTIONS

### Entity A (מרקם - רשת הקהילות המעורבות)
| Connected Org | Relationship |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Gesher** (גשר) | **Co-founder.** Gesher is a religious-secular bridge organization. Provides support and mentoring. |
| **Tzav Piyus** (צו פיוס) | **Co-founder.** Reconciliation initiative. Director Aliza Gershon attended founding. |
| **Neemanei Torah VeAvodah** (נאמני תורה ועבודה) | Hosts מרקם content on their website. Ideological affinity — moderate religious Zionism. |
| **MAKOM** (מועצת הקהילות) | Umbrella organization for 15 community networks. מרקם is likely a member network. |
| **Meitarim** (מיתרים) | Network of mixed Jewish education communities. Related concept. |
| **Beit Prat** (בית פרת) | Israeli midrasha that references community models. |
| **Panim** (פנים) | Civil society organization — hosts מרקם profile page. |

### Entity B (המרחב החברתי)
| Connected Org | Relationship |
|---------------|-------------|
| **JTLV** (real estate) | Donated the Pussycat building. Led by Amir Biram, Ariel Roter, Shalom Fisher. |
| **עמותת תודעה** (Toda'a) | Runs sexuality education workshops at the Social Space. |
| **Masa Israel** | Promotes tours at the Social Space for diaspora participants. |
| **Shatil/NIF** | Weak connection: Dr. Omer Kinnan (researcher) is featured on Shatil testimonials. |
| **IDF/Reserves** | Ongoing collaboration hosting activities for soldiers and reservists. |

### NOT Connected To:
- **Yad B'Yad** — No connection found
- **Sikkuy** — No connection found (Sikkuy deals with Jewish-Arab equality)
- **Givat Haviva** — No connection found to these entities
- **Abraham Fund** — No connection found

**These coexistence organizations deal with Jewish-Arab relations, while Entity A (מרקם) deals with religious-secular Jewish relations — fundamentally different domains.**

---

## 8. CONTROVERSIES & MEDIA

### No Major Controversies Found
- The Social Space (Entity B) experienced **false rumors** about a plan to establish a synagogue in the former strip club — these were debunked
- The Pussycat club's closure itself was controversial (closure of a strip club raises free-market vs. exploitation debates)
- **Mishmar HaChinuch** (Guardian of State Education) — a watchdog organization founded by Givat Haviva, IDEA, and others — includes the "סיור פני אדם" program in its **database of Gefen programs with ideological content**, alongside programs by Im Tirtzu, Dror Israel, and others. This is a monitoring/flagging database, not necessarily a condemnation.

### Potential Criticism Areas (Not Yet Documented):
1. **Name confusion**: The Gefen supplier "מרקם" creates confusion with the religious-secular network. Whether intentional or accidental, schools selecting program #31655 might assume they're getting a religious-secular dialogue program and instead receive a feminist anti-trafficking tour with sexuality content.
2. **Sexuality content for minors**: The program involves walking through a former strip club and discussing sexuality, boundaries, and digital responsibility with grades 9-13. Some parents or communities may object.
3. **Gender-differentiated tours**: The fact that male and female participants receive different audio tours raises questions about the pedagogical approach and messaging.
4. **Financial opacity**: NIS 3.37M revenue with 95% private funding and no public donor list.

---

## 9. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. **What is the legal/contractual relationship between the Gefen supplier "מרקם" and "למרחב לשינוי חברתי" (580354538)?** Is "מרקם" a trade name (שם מסחרי) of Entity B? Or is one of the other entities (A or C) the actual Gefen supplier that subcontracts to the Social Space?

2. **Who are the major private donors** to Entity B (NIS 3.2M unaccounted)?

3. **Does "עמותת תודעה" (Toda'a) have any role in the Gefen program delivery?** They run sexuality workshops at the Social Space.

4. **Board member Eyal Biram** — is he related to Amir Biram of JTLV (the building donor)?

5. **Why is Entity B registered since 2000** but the Social Space only opened in 2019? What did "למרחב לשינוי חברתי" do for the first 19 years?

6. **Are there parent complaints** about the program's sexuality content from any of the 6 schools using it?
