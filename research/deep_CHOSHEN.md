## Executive Summary / Thesis

CHOSHEN is Israel's dominant LGBTQ+ education-in-schools organization, operating as the education and advocacy arm of the gay community since its origins in 1976. It is a **single-issue organization** -- every program, workshop, and activity centers on sexual orientation and gender identity. It holds 6 programs in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog, ALL flagged with gender theme. Despite being structured as a public benefit company (chelatz), it functions as an advocacy organization that has systematically embedded itself into the state education system through Ministry of Education recognition, Gefen catalog approval, and dedicated budget lines. The organization is currently in crisis due to 85% budget cuts under the current government coalition, which explicitly targeted LGBTQ+ education programs.

**Key finding:** CHOSHEN represents a case study in how a volunteer-based advocacy organization achieved institutional integration into state education -- and how that integration became politically vulnerable when government priorities shifted.

## 2. Finances

### Known Financial Data

| Metric | Amount | Year/Period | Source |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **MoE Tolerance Program budget (pre-cut)** | NIS 3,000,000 | ~2023 | Jerusalem Post |
| **MoE Tolerance Program budget (post-cut)** | NIS 300,000 | 2024 | Jerusalem Post |
| **Government LGBTQ+ allocation (all ministries)** | NIS 10,000,000 | 2016 agreement | CECI / eJewish Philanthropy |
| **School lectures allocation (Hoshen-primary)** | NIS 1,500,000 | 2016 agreement | CECI |
| **Workshop fee** | Up to NIS 1,000 per session | Current | HaMigdalor |
| **State LGBTQ+ funding (pre-war)** | $28,400,000 (all orgs) | Pre-2023 | eJewish Philanthropy |
| **State LGBTQ+ funding (current)** | $7,400,000 (all orgs) | 2025 | eJewish Philanthropy |
| **NIF grant** | $15,000 | Unknown year | NIF Israel |
| **MoE request (Hoshen estimate)** | NIS 8,000,000 needed | 2024 | CEO statement |

### Funding Sources (Identified)

1. **Ministry of Education** -- Dedicated budget line (since 2017) for tolerance workshops; severely cut in 2024
2. **Tel Aviv Municipality** -- Economic support since July 2007
3. **New Israel Fund (NIF)** -- $15,000 grant for media campaign and lobbying regarding government cuts to LGBTQ+ tolerance education funding
4. **A Wider Bridge** -- Impact grants recipient (US-based LGBTQ+ pro-Israel organization)
5. **Workshop fees** -- Schools/institutions pay up to NIS 1,000 per 90-minute session; described as "primary source of budget"
6. **Private donations** -- From foundations and individual donors in Israel and abroad
7. **IsraelGives platform** -- Active donation page at israelgives.org/amuta/513544494

### Financial Transparency Assessment

GuideStar transparency rating is only **57% (2.5/5 stars)**. Financial reports are referenced as available but not publicly displayed on IsraelGives page (marked as "download_no"). The organization claims transparency on its website and the Ministry of Justice website, but actual revenue/expense figures are not readily accessible through public searches.

**Gap:** No annual revenue figure, total budget, or audited financial statement was findable through web research. The organization charges fees for workshops (NIS 1,000 each, ~2,000 workshops/year = up to NIS 2M in fee revenue alone, plus government and donor funding). Estimated total annual budget likely in the NIS 3-6M range based on available data points, but this is speculative.

## 3. Leadership

### Current Leadership

| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Mor Nahari (מור נהרי)** | CEO (מנכ"לית) | Current CEO. Publicly advocates for Hoshen; appeared on Ynet, 102FM, government campus lectures. Previously Data Analyst at Ben Gurion University. |
| **Tamar Yahel (תמר יהל)** | Former CEO | Led the organization during its growth period. Initiated programs including LGBTQ+ curriculum in public schools, training for police/military/medical staff. Listed in Rayah Fund as "amplifying women's voices." |

### Founding Figure

| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Dr. Moshe Dov (דוקטור משה דב)** | Founder (1976) | Established the original Lecturing Service within The Aguda |

### Board / Governance Structure

The organization is structured as a chelatz (public benefit company), meaning:
- **Board of Directors (Direktorion)**: Open to volunteers who have completed at least one year of active volunteering
- **Chairperson**: Elected from among active volunteers
- Specific director names were **not findable** through public web searches. GuideStar's "People" page (guidestar.org.il/organization/513544494/people) exists but is JavaScript-rendered and could not be scraped.

**Gap:** Board member names are a significant gap. The chelatz structure means directors are drawn from the volunteer pool rather than external appointments, which limits external oversight.

## 4. Programs

### Overview

CHOSHEN operates approximately **2,000 workshops annually** in **350 institutions**, reaching approximately **50,000-100,000 people per year** (different sources give different figures). The primary delivery mechanism is **personal narrative workshops** where LGBTQ+ volunteers share their coming-out stories and experiences.

### Gefen Catalog Programs

The user identified 6 programs in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog, ALL flagged with gender theme. Key programs include:

| Gefen # | Program Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **15862** | להט"ב לחט"ב (LGBT for Middle School) | Makes LGBT topics accessible to middle school students (grades 7-9) using storytelling cards about LGBTQ+ youth lives and children of proud (same-sex) families |
| **24985** | עבודה רגישת מגדר ונטיה מינית (Gender-Sensitive Work and Sexual Orientation) | Professional training for educators on gender-sensitive approaches |

### Main Workshop Types (from HaMigdalor and Hoshen website)

1. **"Hoshen for Education Teams"** -- Training staff on LGBTQ+ youth issues, combating homophobia. For education professionals from kindergarten through high school.
2. **"The Israeli Story" (הסיפור הישראלי)** -- Explores LGBTQ+ experiences in contemporary Israel through personal narratives. Available for grades 9+.
3. **"The Social Story" (הסיפור החברתי)** -- Focuses on creating safe school environments through peer responsibility.
4. **"Personal Story" Workshop (סיפור אישי)** -- Core methodology: LGBTQ+ facilitators share personal experiences with sexual orientation and gender identity, including coming-out process. For grades 9+ (per organization guidelines) but the Gefen program #15862 targets middle school (grades 7-9).
5. **Civic Studies Program** -- 33-meeting curriculum for high school students covering LGBT history, activists, and civil rights equality. Developed after Ministry of Education civic studies curriculum reform.
6. **Sagi Golan Memorial Program** -- Named after an IDF soldier killed on October 7, 2023. Focus on "tolerance, equality and leadership." Operated through Hoshen. Reached over 50,000 students before budget cuts.

### Workshop Delivery Details

- **Duration:** 90 minutes per session
- **Cost:** Up to NIS 1,000 per workshop
- **Languages:** Hebrew, Arabic, English, Russian
- **Geographic scope:** Nationwide (Golan Heights to Mitzpe Ramon)
- **Facilitators:** ~250 volunteers (LGBTQ+ individuals age 23+)
- **Volunteer training:** Screening process, weekend seminar, personal story development, one monthly commitment during school year

### Age Range and Content

**Critical observation:** The organization works with education staff "from kindergarten through high school" (מגיל הגן ועד התיכון). While direct student workshops begin at grade 7 (middle school) per the Gefen catalog entry, **educator training covers kindergarten teachers**. A 2012 program was introduced at two academic colleges specifically training kindergarten teachers to "deal with children raised in LGBT families."

The **"LGBT for Middle School" (להט"ב לחט"ב)** program (Gefen #15862) specifically targets grades 7-9 (ages ~12-15). Content includes:
- Storytelling cards about the daily lives of LGBTQ+ youth
- Cards about children of same-sex families
- Exploration of gender roles and expectations through students' own experiences
- Workshop activities designed for adolescent developmental stage

## 5. Ideology and Theoretical Framework

### Single-Issue Organization Assessment: YES

CHOSHEN is unambiguously a **single-issue organization**. Every program, workshop, training, and activity centers on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). All 6 Gefen catalog programs are gender-flagged. The organization's mission statement, activities, and public communications all revolve exclusively around LGBTQ+ advocacy and education.

### Theoretical Framework

The organization does not explicitly name a theoretical framework (e.g., queer theory, gender studies). However, its operational approach reveals several ideological commitments:

1. **Contact hypothesis**: The core methodology is the "personal story" -- direct contact between LGBTQ+ individuals and non-LGBTQ+ audiences, premised on the social psychology theory that prejudice decreases through interpersonal contact.

2. **Gender spectrum model**: Programs present "the spectrum of identities in the LGBTQ+ community" and emphasize "the importance of distinguishing between sexual practice, gender identity, and sexual orientation" (three separate dimensions).

3. **Social constructionism of gender roles**: The middle school program explicitly explores "gender roles and expectations through students' own experiences," framing gender roles as constructed rather than inherent.

4. **Safe space ideology**: Core goal is creating "safe and secure spaces for LGBTQ+ youth" -- framing school environments as potentially hostile and requiring intervention.

5. **Advocacy-as-education model**: The organization self-describes as "the education and advocacy center of the LGBTQ+ community" -- not distinguishing between education and advocacy. The 33-meeting civic studies program is designed to "familiarize [students] with activists and the fight for civil rights equality."

### Academic Research

One peer-reviewed study measured Hoshen's effectiveness:
- **Study**: "Changing Attitudes of High School Students in Israel toward Homosexuality" (Journal of LGBT Youth, 2016)
- **Sample**: 272 students across 3 high schools, pre/post questionnaires
- **Findings**: Improvement in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral subscales of attitudes toward homosexuality
- **Note**: This study was conducted on Hoshen's own workshops; it is unclear whether the study was independent or commissioned by the organization

### Hebrew vs. English Messaging Comparison

- **Hebrew website/materials**: Emphasizes "ארגון החינוך וההסברה של הקהילה הגאה" (the education and **advocacy** organization of the gay community)
- **English website**: Emphasizes "education and information center" -- the word "advocacy" is softened
- **Internal Hebrew framing**: Uses "שינוי עמדות שליליות" (changing negative attitudes) -- explicitly acknowledges attitude-change as the goal
- **English framing**: Focuses on "tolerance" and "understanding" -- less explicit about attitude modification

## 6. Network and Ecosystem Connections

### Direct Organizational Connections

| Organization | Relationship | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **The Aguda (האגודה למען הלהט"ב)** | Origin organization; ongoing cooperation | Hoshen was literally the education arm of The Aguda until 2004 independence |
| **IGY (Israeli Gay Youth)** | Program cooperation | Named as cooperation partner in Civic Studies program |
| **Tehila (תהילה)** | Program cooperation | Israeli "PFLAG" (Parents and Friends of LGBTQ+); cooperation partner |
| **Jerusalem Open House** | Cooperation | Listed as collaborative partner |
| **Ma'avarim (מעברים)** | OHCHR coalition co-member | Israeli Transgender Community organization |
| **Havruta (חברותא)** | OHCHR coalition co-member | Religious LGBTQ+ organization |
| **Be'er Sheva LGBT House** | Cooperation | Regional partner |
| **Community House Haifa** | Cooperation | Regional partner |
| **Project Gila** | Cooperation | LGBTQ+ community organization |

### Funding/Support Network

| Organization | Type | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| **New Israel Fund (NIF)** | Funder | $15,000 grant for media campaign and lobbying |
| **A Wider Bridge** | Funder/Partner | US-based LGBTQ+ pro-Israel org; impact grants; hosted Hoshen CEO on Pride Leadership Mission |
| **Tel Aviv Municipality** | Government funder | Since 2007 |
| **Ministry of Education (SHaFI)** | Government recognition | Official recognition by the Educational Psychological Authority (שפ"י); Gefen catalog approval |

### International Coalition

Hoshen is a member of the **LGBTQ Coalition Israel** that submitted documentation to the UN Human Rights Council (OHCHR). Coalition members include:
- Hoshen - Education and Change
- Ha-Aguda - National Association of LGBT in Israel
- Havruta - Religious Gays
- Ma'avarim - Israeli Transgender Community
- Tehila - Support for Parents and Families of LGBT
- The LGBT House in Be'er Sheva
- The Association of Israeli Gay Fathers

### ILGA Membership

Hoshen is listed by the **International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA)** as the largest LGBTQ+ organization in Israel.

### Connection to Sex-Ed Ecosystem

The user asked specifically about connections to **Maga BeTiaum**, **Meyda Amin**, and similar sex-ed organizations. No direct organizational links were found in web research between Hoshen and these specific entities. However, they operate in overlapping spaces:
- All deliver external programs in schools through the Gefen catalog
- All address sexuality/gender topics in educational settings
- The Gefen catalog creates a marketplace where schools can choose from multiple providers in the same thematic area

**Gap:** No evidence of formal partnership, shared personnel, or financial links between Hoshen and Maga BeTiaum or Meyda Amin was found. They appear to be independent operators in the same market niche.

## 7. Controversies

### Avi Maoz / Noam Party Conflict (2022-2024) -- MAJOR

The most significant controversy is the political battle with **Avi Maoz** (Noam party), who was appointed Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office with authority over **external programming in the Ministry of Education** in January 2023.

**Key events:**
1. **Coalition deal (Dec 2022):** Netanyahu's coalition gave Maoz authority to monitor and potentially veto external educational content entering schools
2. **Proposed legislation:** Maoz introduced a bill to **ban teaching sexual orientation content before 9th grade** (age ~15). This would have eliminated Hoshen's middle school program (Gefen #15862 "LGBT for Middle School")
3. **50+ local authorities** declared intent to boycott Maoz's policies
4. **Hoshen response:** Characterized Maoz's efforts as "evil" attempts to portray their work as problematic rather than protective
5. **Maoz received NIS 25 million** for his "Jewish National Identity Authority" -- compared to the NIS 300K remaining for LGBTQ+ tolerance education

**Quote from outgoing Education Minister Yifat Shasha-Biton:** "A man whose faith is hatred will be in charge of the content taught to our children" -- calling the decision "a moral disgrace."

### 85% Budget Cut (2024) -- MAJOR

The "Tolerance Program" budget was cut from NIS 3 million to NIS 300,000 -- an 85% reduction. This resulted in:
- **4,200 workshops canceled**
- **145,000 students** losing access to tolerance education
- CEO Mor Nahari publicly requested NIS 8 million from Education Minister Yoav Kisch to reach all schools

Context: This occurred as Israel recorded **3,309 instances of violence and hate speech** targeting LGBTQ+ individuals in 2022 (11% increase from 2021).

### State LGBTQ+ Funding Collapse (2023-2025)

Broader than just Hoshen:
- Total state funding for LGBTQ+ initiatives: $28.4M (pre-war) --> $12.4M (2024) --> $7.4M (2025)
- **74% reduction** from pre-war levels
- Six national LGBTQ+ organizations depend on government funding for ~50% of budgets
- Multiple program closures across the sector

### Trans Student Removal Incident (2022-2023)

Hoshen publicly opposed the Ministry of Education's decision to remove a trans boy from a religious school in central Israel after parents protested. Hoshen stated: "This ministry decided that political and social considerations are more important than the safety and wellbeing of a small boy."

### Age-Appropriateness Debate

The core ongoing debate:
- **Hoshen's position:** Their programs are age-appropriate; they train kindergarten teachers (not direct student contact at that age) and deliver student workshops from grade 7+
- **Critics' position (Noam, religious communities):** LGBTQ+ content should not be introduced before age 15 at earliest; kindergarten teacher training about "children raised in LGBT families" is ideological normalization
- **Hoshen describes this work as:** Providing "safe and secure spaces for LGBTQ+ youth" and combating discrimination
- **No specific documented parent complaints** against Hoshen workshops were found in web research, though the political opposition is substantial

### "Pinkwashing" Critique (from the left)

Some left-wing/pro-Palestinian organizations have criticized Israel's LGBTQ+ advocacy ecosystem (including Hoshen through its A Wider Bridge connection) as contributing to "pinkwashing" -- using LGBTQ+ rights as propaganda to mask Palestinian oppression. This is a critique of the entire Israeli LGBTQ+ sector, not Hoshen specifically.

## 8. Ministry of Education Relationship

### How 6 Gender Programs Got Approved in Gefen

The Gefen (Flexibility in Pedagogical-Managerial) system is a Ministry of Education reform that creates a marketplace of approved external program providers. Schools choose programs from the catalog using their allocated budgets.

**Hoshen's path to Gefen approval:**

1. **SHaFI Recognition (שפ"י):** Hoshen is officially recognized by the Ministry of Education's Educational Psychological Advisory Service (SHaFI). This is the key institutional endorsement -- the psychological/counseling authority of the ministry vouches for the programs.

2. **Dedicated Budget Line (2017):** A specific budget line was opened in the Ministry of Education for "activities regarding sexual orientation and gender identity." This was a political achievement -- converting ad hoc funding into a structural budget item.

3. **2016 Treasury Agreement:** The cross-ministerial agreement led by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon allocated NIS 10M for LGBTQ+ community services, including NIS 1.5M specifically for school lectures/information -- effectively earmarking government money for organizations like Hoshen.

4. **Gefen Catalog Listing:** With SHaFI recognition and dedicated budget lines, Gefen catalog approval followed. The 6 programs cover the full spectrum of the organization's offerings: middle school (7-9), high school (10-12), and educator training.

5. **All 6 programs gender-flagged:** This is consistent with the organization's single-issue nature -- every program addresses gender/sexuality topics. There is no diversification into other educational themes.

### Current Status

- **Gefen rating:** 3/5
- **Current deployments:** Zero (per user's data)
- **Catalog presence:** Still listed (6 programs)

The zero-deployment status despite catalog presence likely reflects:
- The 85% budget cut making schools unable to afford workshops
- Political chilling effect from the Maoz controversy
- Schools avoiding the topic to prevent parental backlash
- The NIS 1,000 per workshop cost without subsidies

### Structural Analysis

Hoshen's Ministry relationship follows a pattern:
1. Build volunteer base and reputation (2004-2016)
2. Achieve institutional recognition (SHaFI endorsement)
3. Secure dedicated budget lines (2016-2017)
4. Enter Gefen catalog (systematic marketplace presence)
5. Face political reversal when government changes (2022-present)

This is NOT regulatory capture in the classic sense -- Hoshen didn't write the rules or control the regulator. Rather, it's institutional embedding: a civil society organization that became the de facto sole provider of a specific educational service, making it both essential and vulnerable.

## 9. Values Alignment Assessment

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Transparency** | 2/5 | Low GuideStar rating (57%); financial reports not publicly accessible; board member names not public |
| **Parental choice** | 2/5 | Programs brought into schools by principals; parents not directly consulted; kindergarten teacher training occurs without parental knowledge |
| **Age-appropriateness** | 3/5 | Student workshops start at grade 7 (age 12-13); educator training extends to kindergarten level; age boundaries exist but are being pushed downward |
| **Educational neutrality** | 1/5 | Self-described as "advocacy" organization in Hebrew; explicitly aims to "change negative attitudes"; not a neutral educational provider |
| **Diversity of viewpoint** | 2/5 | Single ideological framework; no religious or traditional perspectives represented; volunteers are exclusively LGBTQ+ |
| **Democratic legitimacy** | 3/5 | Achieved catalog approval through proper channels; budget allocated through democratic process; but sustained via bureaucratic embedding rather than ongoing popular mandate |
| **Impact evidence** | 3/5 | One peer-reviewed study (2016) shows attitude change; but study measured Hoshen's own workshops; limited independent evaluation |

## 10. Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Board member identities:** Who sits on the chelatz board? What are their professional backgrounds? Do any have Ministry of Education connections?
2. **Actual annual revenue:** The estimated NIS 3-6M range needs verification through official financial filings
3. **Volunteer screening:** What is the actual screening process for the 250 volunteers who enter schools? Background checks?
4. **Workshop content audit:** What exactly is said in a 90-minute workshop? Are there recordings, transcripts, or observer reports?
5. **Gefen approval process:** Who at SHaFI specifically approved these programs? What review criteria were applied?
6. **Connection to academic gender studies:** Do Hoshen's program developers have academic gender studies backgrounds? Is queer theory explicitly part of the curriculum?
7. **Middle school content specifics:** The "LGBT for Middle School" program (Gefen #15862) -- what are the specific storytelling cards? What narratives are presented to 12-year-olds?
8. **Zero deployments:** Is this a permanent state or temporary (seasonal/budget-related)? Are schools actively removing Hoshen or just not ordering?
9. **Cross-entity funding:** Does money flow between Hoshen, The Aguda, and other coalition members? Are the same donors funding multiple organizations?
10. **IDF and police training:** Hoshen trains soldiers, police, and border guard officers. What is the content? Is this mandatory?
