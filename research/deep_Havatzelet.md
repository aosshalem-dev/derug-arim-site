## THESIS STATEMENT

Havatzelet is not merely a cultural foundation -- it is the financial and organizational spine of a 113-year-old ideological ecosystem that spans youth indoctrination, formal and informal education, land assets, international fundraising, cultural production, and political influence. Through its parent-subsidiary structure, Havatzelet channels approximately NIS 85M+ annually (combining Havatzelet's NIS 49.4M and the youth movement's NIS 35.6M) across institutions that operate inside Israeli schools via Ministry of Education contracts, train pre-military youth, run an international boarding school, maintain Holocaust education programs, and sustain one of the largest archives of left-Zionist history. The movement's political alumni created Mapam and Meretz, and its institutional network -- Givat Haviva, Yad Yaari, Moreshet, Tzavta, GHIS -- functions as a parallel educational infrastructure funded substantially by the state while advancing a specific ideological worldview rooted in socialist-Zionism, Jewish-Arab "shared society," and secular humanism.

### 1.3 "Havatzelet HaChadasha" (The New Havatzelet)

In 2022, the Kibbutz Movement's 6th Convention approved the establishment of "Havatzelet HaChadasha" -- a new funding mechanism. In 2023, it distributed NIS 12 million (with an additional NIS 2M supplement) to organizations focused on youth movements, archives, cultural bodies, and "social influence activities." The Kibbutz Movement Council with 125 delegates from ~93 kibbutzim approved the budget. Notably, the 2023 resolution stipulated that funded organizations must "participate in and identify with the struggle" against the judicial overhaul -- an explicit politicization of grant funding.

**Key Leadership of Havatzelet HaChadasha:**
- Chair: Amos Rabin (Kibbutz Yikum)
- CEO: Uzi Shash (Kibbutz Mizra)

### 1.4 The Kibbutz Artzi Connection

Kibbutz Artzi (הקיבוץ הארצי) was founded in 1927 as HaShomer HaTzair's settlement movement, establishing 85 kibbutzim. In 1999, Kibbutz Artzi merged with the United Kibbutz Movement (UKM) but maintained certain autonomy. Havatzelet holds the historical assets of the Kibbutz Artzi. The first Kibbutz Artzi kibbutz to privatize was Kibbutz Snir in 1994.

## 2. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Revenue Overview

**Havatzelet (510490451) -- Latest Year (2025): NIS 49,357,121**

| Revenue Source | Amount (NIS) | % |
|---------------|-------------|---|
| Government transfers (3-year total) | 33,078,093 | ~67% of annual revenue |
| Contracts | 20,015,876 | |
| Support/Grants | 13,062,217 | |
| Other (donations, self-generated) | ~16,279,028 | ~33% |

### 2.2 Government Transfers by Ministry (3-Year Aggregate)

| Ministry | Amount (NIS) | Key Categories |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Israel Land Authority (רמ"י)** | 20,000,000 | Land compensation |
| **Culture & Sports** | 15,030,698 | Archives, theater projects, cultural institutions |
| **Education** | 9,430,851 | Activity support, Holocaust museums, coexistence programs |
| **Treasury** | 1,500,000 | COVID-19 emergency assistance |
| **Social Services** | 106,955 | Energy efficiency |
| **Economy & Industry** | 87,239 | Energy efficiency |
| **Central Bureau of Statistics** | 30,000 | Holocaust course contracts |
| **Interior** | 19,500 | Conference catering |
| **Foreign Ministry** | 15,876 | Exhibition production |
| **Health** | 1,900 | Professional training |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** The NIS 20M from Israel Land Authority for "land compensation" is the single largest government transfer. This likely relates to kibbutz land return agreements -- a pattern where kibbutzim return agricultural land to the state in exchange for compensation. The land authority paid NIS 2.4 billion to kibbutzim nationally since 2015 for returned agricultural land.

### 2.3 Youth Movement Financial Data

**Histadrut HaShomer HaTzair (580001659) -- 2024: NIS 35,607,389**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Staff | 140 employees, 300 volunteers |
| Sector rank | 9th highest government-funded in education |
| 3-year government total | NIS 53,809,290 |

**Ministry of Education Breakdown (3-year):**
- Youth Movement Support: NIS 77,264,440
- Pre-Service Volunteers (Shinshirim): NIS 51,749,535
- Youth Activities/Maintenance: NIS 22,830,967
- Various Activity Support: NIS 14,329,002

**Total Ministry of Education funding to youth movement (3 years): NIS 169,934,213**

This is an extraordinary figure -- NIS ~57M/year from the Education Ministry alone to the youth movement entity. Combined with Havatzelet's NIS 9.4M from Education, the ecosystem receives approximately NIS 66M/year from the Ministry of Education.

### 2.4 US Fundraising (Friends of Givat Haviva -- EIN 13-2584337)

| Year | Revenue (USD) | Expenses | Net | Assets |
|------|--------------|----------|-----|--------|
| 2024 | $2,296,925 | $2,046,306 | +$250,619 | $1,987,322 |
| 2023 | $6,112,635 | $5,500,112 | +$612,523 | $1,715,447 |
| 2022 | $1,679,058 | $2,084,416 | -$405,358 | $1,103,532 |
| 2021 | $2,799,978 | $1,527,128 | +$1,272,850 | $1,485,431 |

**Notes:**
- Tax-exempt since July 1967 (same year as Havatzelet's founding)
- 4/4 Star rating on Charity Navigator (92% score)
- 99.3% of revenue from contributions
- Charity Navigator category: International Peace and Security
- Key staff: Sarah Baker Wacks (Development Coordinator, $79,297 compensation)
- Board: David Heller (Chair), Larry Garber (Treasurer), Judith Scheuer (Secretary) -- all uncompensated
- The 2023 spike to $6.1M suggests a major fundraising event or bequest

### 2.5 Aggregate Financial Estimate

| Stream | Annual (NIS, estimated) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Havatzelet revenue | 49,400,000 |
| Youth movement revenue | 35,600,000 |
| US fundraising (Friends of GH) | ~8,000,000 |
| Havatzelet HaChadasha grants | 14,000,000 |
| Other international "Friends" orgs | ~3,000,000 (est.) |

## 4. IDEOLOGY & PROGRAMS

### 4.1 Core Ideology: The Three Pillars

HaShomer HaTzair's ideology rests on three pillars, symbolized in its movement emblem:

1. **Zionism** -- Connection to Jewish peoplehood and Israeli statehood. Described as "the most central value" in the movement's education.
2. **Socialism** -- Worker's dignity, cooperative living, kibbutz ideal. Originally Marxist (influenced by Ber Borochov), now described as "social justice."
3. **Brotherhood of Nations** (אחוות עמים) -- International solidarity and peace. In practice, this manifests as Jewish-Arab coexistence programs and anti-occupation positions.

**Added value (centennial conference):** Feminism and gender equality.

### 4.2 Educational Methodology

The movement combines **experiential/scout-style education** with **ideological enrichment**. Youth are organized into "kenim" (dens/branches) across 6 regional zones in Israel (~80 branches, ~10,000 active youth). Members progress through age-appropriate cohorts with Hebrew names.

**Pre-military service year (שנת שירות/שנשינים):** A major program where young adults volunteer for a year before IDF service. This program received NIS 51.7M over 3 years from the Education Ministry. In 2024, the movement warned that 25% cuts to this program would "harm national rehabilitation."

### 4.3 Givat Haviva Educational Programs

**Jewish-Arab Center for Peace (est. 1963):**
- The oldest and largest institution in Israel promoting Jewish-Arab reconciliation
- Reaches ~3,000 youth annually through dialogue programs
- Teacher training courses for "shared society" education
- Regional partnership programs between neighboring Jewish and Arab municipalities
- Empowerment initiatives for Arab communities including Hebrew language instruction

**Gefen (Ministry of Education Approved) Programs:**
1. **Children Teaching Children (CTC)** -- Running for 34 years. Jewish and Arab student groups meet at Givat Haviva and in schools. Two-year civics program exploring national identity, community, conflicting narratives.
2. **Connection for a Change** -- Two-day seminar bringing Jewish and Arab students for "dialogue at eye level in a spirit of leadership."
3. **Partnership and Belonging** -- Educational journey breaking down barriers between Jewish and Arab youth through encounters.
4. **Environmental Education** -- Integrating 6th-grade students from neighboring Arab and Jewish communities in sustainability projects.

**GHIS -- Givat Haviva International School (est. 2018):**
- IB Diploma Programme for grades 10-12
- Student composition: 25% Israeli Jewish, 25% Israeli Arab, 50% international
- Full boarding school on Givat Haviva campus
- Mission: "developing leaders for shared society and sustainable, just future"
- Part of Havatzelet group

**Pre-Military Academy (Mechina):**
- Named after Haviva Reik (the paratrooper)
- Secular-humanist orientation
- Trains future IDF leaders with focus on humanistic leadership
- Located on Givat Haviva campus

**Arabic Language Institute:**
- Courses in Arabic including distance learning
- Duration: weeks to six months

**Moreshet (est. 1961):**
- Holocaust education center, named for Mordechai Anielewicz (Warsaw Ghetto uprising leader who was a HaShomer HaTzair member)
- Publications, study guides, educational tours
- Works with Ministry of Education via Gefen system

**Yad Yaari (est. 1983):**
- Central archive of HaShomer HaTzair movement
- Named after Meir Yaari, the movement's ideological founder
- Houses over 100 years of movement documentation
- Research department for historical and social studies

**Art Center:**
- Galleries, ceramics studios, sculpture gardens
- Community art programs

### 4.4 Semantic Displacement Analysis: Hebrew vs. English Messaging

| Concept | Hebrew Messaging | English Messaging | Gap |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Zionism** | "הציונות היא הערך המרכזי ביותר" (Zionism is THE most central value) | "Progressive-Zionist youth movement" | Hebrew is much stronger on Zionism as central; English softens to "progressive-Zionist" |
| **Socialism** | סוציאליזם, כבוד העובד, חיי שיתוף (socialism, worker dignity, cooperative life) | "Social justice," "economic justice," "mutual responsibility" | Hebrew uses explicit socialist terminology; English translates to softer progressive language |
| **Arab-Jewish relations** | חברה משותפת, אחוות עמים (shared society, brotherhood of nations) | "Shared society," "coexistence," "peace education" | Roughly aligned, though English adds "peace" framing absent in Hebrew |
| **Political activism** | The 2023 Havatzelet HaChadasha required grantees to "participate in struggle against judicial overhaul" | US messaging emphasizes "democracy" and "liberal values" | Hebrew is explicitly partisan; English is coded in democratic values language |
| **Military service** | Pre-military academy, service year (שנת שירות) are prominently featured | Barely mentioned on English sites | English audiences don't see the movement's deep IDF integration |
| **Self-description** | "כלי לעשייה, מעורבות והשפעה בחברה הישראלית" (tool for action, involvement and influence) | "Education and Culture Institutions" | Hebrew is explicit about societal influence; English is neutral/institutional |

**Key finding:** The English-language presentation systematically softens the movement's ideological intensity. Socialist language becomes "social justice." Zionist centrality is diluted. Political activism is reframed as democratic values. The pre-military and IDF connection -- a major component of the Israeli program -- is essentially invisible in English materials. This is a textbook case of **semantic displacement** for different donor/audience populations.

### 4.5 The "Dibrot" (Commandments) of HaShomer HaTzair

The movement maintains a set of principles called "Dibrot HaShomer HaTzair" (דברות השומר הצעיר) posted on their website. While the page blocked direct access during research, the known pillars include: Zionism, socialism, brotherhood of nations, feminism/gender equality, secular Judaism, and pioneering (חלוציות).

---

## 5. GOVERNMENT TIES & INFLUENCE

### 5.1 Ministry of Education Access Points

The Havatzelet ecosystem accesses Israeli schools through multiple channels:

1. **Direct Youth Movement Funding:** NIS ~57M/year from Education Ministry to the youth movement entity (580001659)
2. **Gefen Program Catalog:** Multiple Givat Haviva programs are approved in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog, allowing school principals to purchase Jewish-Arab encounter programs, Holocaust education, and environmental programs using Education Ministry budgets
3. **Service Year (Shinshirim):** NIS 51.7M over 3 years for pre-military volunteers placed in communities, essentially embedding movement-trained young adults throughout Israel
4. **Holocaust Education:** Moreshet runs Ministry-approved programs and contracts
5. **Teacher Training:** Givat Haviva trains teachers in "shared society education"

### 5.2 Other Government Funding Channels

- **Israel Land Authority:** NIS 20M for land compensation (kibbutz land return)
- **Ministry of Culture & Sports:** NIS 15M (3-year) for archives (Yad Yaari), theater (Tzavta), cultural institutions
- **Ministry of Finance:** NIS 1.5M COVID emergency
- **Settlement/National Missions Ministry:** Not directly identified in obudget data for this entity, but the kibbutz movement broadly receives settlement-related funding

### 5.3 Non-Formal Education in Arab Society

Havatzelet operates a national service (שירות ארצי) track specifically for "non-formal education in Arab society" -- placing service-year volunteers in Arab communities for educational programming. This is listed on the Kol Sherut national service platform.

### 5.4 Advisory and Institutional Roles

- **UNESCO Advisory Organization:** Givat Haviva received advisory status to the UN in 2018
- **Knesset Committees:** Multiple HaShomer HaTzair alumni served on Education, Culture & Sports committees
- **NIF Partnership:** Givat Haviva collaborated with NIF (New Israel Fund) on the "State Education Guard" initiative to "protect the secular public education stream"

## 6. LEGAL ACTIONS & CONTROVERSIES

### 6.1 Transparency Rating

The user-referenced 63% transparency rating on GuideStar Israel could not be independently verified during this research. GuideStar Israel uses a proprietary scoring system. The organization's GuideStar page exists but is JavaScript-rendered and could not be fully scraped. The fact that the rating is reportedly only 63% (if accurate) is notable for an organization of this size receiving NIS 33M+ in government transfers.

**Possible contributing factors to low transparency:**
- Complex multi-entity structure (institutions within a חל"צ rather than separate amutot)
- Limited public disclosure of internal fund allocation between divisions
- Board composition changes not consistently updated on English-language materials

### 6.2 Givat Haviva and Im Tirtzu

The right-wing organization Im Tirtzu has targeted organizations in the NIF ecosystem, of which Givat Haviva is a grantee. The broader Im Tirtzu campaign (2010) accused NIF-funded organizations of providing material for the Goldstone Report, a claim disputed by NIF (which stated only 1.3% of Goldstone citations came from NIF-supported groups).

Im Tirtzu has also criticized cultural figures associated with leftist organizations. Givat Haviva, as an NIF grantee promoting Jewish-Arab coexistence, falls within the general category of organizations Im Tirtzu targets as "de-legitimizing" Israel.

### 6.3 Kibbutz Movement Transition Issues

The privatization of kibbutzim created tensions around Havatzelet's asset base. Keren Havatzelet holds historical assets of the Kibbutz Artzi, including the Givat Haviva campus and associated properties. The NIS 20M from Israel Land Authority for "land compensation" suggests land transactions in the kibbutz-to-state land return framework. The investigative outlet "Shomrim" has reported on "deal-karka" (land deals) that perpetuate land privileges for kibbutz members -- though no specific investigation of Havatzelet's land dealings was found.

### 6.4 Political Conditioning of Grants

The 2023 Havatzelet HaChadasha budget explicitly required funded organizations to "participate in and identify with the struggle against the judicial overhaul." This is a direct politicization of what is nominally a cultural/educational fund, and could raise legal questions about the tax-exempt status and public-benefit purpose of the entity.

### 6.5 Budget Cuts Controversy (2024)

In 2024, HaShomer HaTzair publicly warned about a 25% cut to Education Ministry support for the shinshirim (pre-military service year) program, worth NIS 17M. The movement stated it had received assurances from the Education Minister and Finance Ministry that cuts would not happen, calling the subsequent reversal "empty promises." The Ministry responded that the 2024 budget would be "similar to 2023."

### 6.6 Post-October 7 Context

During the 2023 war, Givat Haviva's campus provided shelter for approximately 300 evacuees from Ashkelon. A 2025 Haaretz article noted that "Jews and Arabs are flocking to Givat Haviva in masses -- yes, even after October 7th," suggesting the coexistence mission has become both more relevant and more contested.

### 6.7 State Comptroller Findings

No specific State Comptroller reports targeting Havatzelet or Givat Haviva directly were found during this research. This is itself notable -- an organization receiving NIS 33M+ in government transfers over 3 years would typically appear in routine comptroller reviews of ministry spending.

## 9. VALUES ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Transparency** | 2/5 | 63% GuideStar rating (if accurate), multi-entity opacity, English/Hebrew messaging gap, no separate financial reporting for subdivisions |
| **Educational quality** | 4/5 | UNESCO prize, 34-year CTC program track record, IB school, strong Holocaust education |
| **Political neutrality** | 1/5 | Explicitly partisan (2023 anti-judicial-overhaul condition), Mapam-Meretz pipeline, movement ideology baked into educational programs |
| **Financial accountability** | 2/5 | NIS 20M land compensation unexplained publicly, aggregate structure obscures internal allocation, Havatzelet HaChadasha grants conditional on political stance |
| **Ideological honesty** | 2/5 | Systematic semantic displacement between Hebrew and English messaging. Hebrew is explicitly socialist-Zionist; English presents as neutral "education and culture" |
| **Social contribution** | 4/5 | Genuine Jewish-Arab bridge programs, pre-military service, Holocaust education, youth development |
| **Democratic governance** | 3/5 | Board elected by kibbutz movement delegates, but movement represents a narrow ideological slice of Israeli society |

## 10. KEY OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **NIS 20M from Israel Land Authority:** What specific land was returned/compensated? What is the total real estate portfolio of Havatzelet/Givat Haviva campus? What is the estimated market value of the Givat Haviva campus and other movement properties?

2. **Internal fund allocation:** How exactly is the NIS 49.4M distributed among Givat Haviva, Yad Yaari, Moreshet, GHIS, and other subdivisions? No public breakdown exists.

3. **Havatzelet HaChadasha political conditions:** Is it legal for a public-benefit fund to condition grants on political activism (participation in anti-judicial-overhaul protests)?

4. **Youth movement in schools:** What is the exact mechanism by which HaShomer HaTzair branches operate inside public schools? Do they have formal agreements with the Ministry of Education? How does ideological content enter formally neutral school settings?

5. **NIF funding pipeline:** What is the total NIF funding to Givat Haviva over the past decade? The NIF page confirms a relationship but amounts are not public.

6. **State Comptroller coverage gap:** Why has an organization receiving NIS 33M+ in government transfers not been subject to a public State Comptroller review (or if it has, why are results not easily findable)?

7. **GHIS international students:** Where do the 50% international students come from? What is the tuition? Who funds scholarships? What happens to these students after graduation -- do they make aliyah?

8. **Movement decline post-Meretz collapse:** With Meretz failing to enter the Knesset in 2022, has the political pipeline been disrupted? Where do current HaShomer HaTzair alumni direct their political energy?

9. **English website leadership discrepancy:** The English Havatzelet page lists different leadership (Avshalom Vilan as Chair, Uzi Shemesh as CEO) than the Hebrew page (Amos Rabin as Chair, Itamar Shvika as CEO). When did leadership change, and why wasn't the English site updated?

10. **Total alumni count in public positions:** A comprehensive mapping of all current officeholders (municipal, governmental, civil service, academic, media) who are HaShomer HaTzair alumni would reveal the true scope of movement influence.
