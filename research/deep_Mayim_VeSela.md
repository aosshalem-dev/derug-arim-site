## Program: חכמת המעגל (Wisdom of the Circle) + המעגל השלם (The Complete Circle)

**Research Date:** 2026-02-17
**Risk Rating:** 4/5 (per user assessment)

## Executive Summary

"מים וסלע" (Mayim VeSela / Water and Rock) is a **sole proprietorship** (osek mursheh) operated by **מיכאל סלע אברהם (Michael Sela Abraham)**, registered as business number **21390919**. Based in **Carmiel (כרמיאל)**, the business runs two Gefen-catalog programs in Israeli schools:

1. **חכמת המעגל** (Wisdom of the Circle) — Gefen #5454, focused on Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) via circle-based dialogue
2. **המעגל השלם** (The Complete Circle) — Gefen #26623, focused on climate-social education combining sustainability with emotional-social development

The organization claims **15+ years of experience** and **500,000+ children served**, employs **11-50 people** (per AllJobs), and operates nationally as a Gefen supplier. The current contract under review: 3 cities, 3 schools, budget NIS 30,000.

**Thesis:** This is a one-man educational enterprise that has built a legitimate Gefen-approved business around circle-based SEL methodology. The "circle" approach draws from the broader "Way of Council" / talking circles tradition, adapted into a secular SEL framework. The climate education component introduces sustainability/social-responsibility values. There is **no detected connection** to Kabbalah/Laitman (despite a same-named book), no detected partisan political ideology, and no gender/sexuality programming. However, the operator's personal professional background remains largely opaque, and the business structure (sole proprietorship) avoids amuta transparency requirements.

## 1. Who is Michael Sela Abraham?

### What We Know
- **Full name:** מיכאל סלע אברהם (also rendered as סלע אברהם מיכאל in official records)
- **Role:** Founder, owner, and director of "מים וסלע — העשרה חינוכית" (Water and Rock — Educational Enrichment)
- **Self-description:** Teacher, educator, and educational entrepreneur
- **Contact phone:** 054-767-1297
- **Email for staff recruitment:** msmadrihim@gmail.com
- **Location:** Based in Carmiel (כרמיאל), northern Israel

### What We Don't Know (Gaps)
- **No discoverable academic credentials** — no university degrees, no certifications in psychology, counseling, social work, or education found online
- **No LinkedIn profile found** matching this person
- **No Facebook presence found** for the business or personal profile
- **No media interviews, conference appearances, or published articles** found
- **No professional association memberships** found (not listed in the Israeli Association of Family Counselors and Therapists, no NLP certification found)
- **Training background** in circle facilitation methodology is unverified — no connection to Uriel Center (the main Israeli Way of Council training center), no connection to Ojai Foundation

**Assessment:** The operator is effectively invisible outside his own website and the Gefen catalog. For someone claiming 15+ years and 500,000 children, this is a notably thin public profile. This is not inherently suspicious (many small Gefen suppliers are low-profile), but it means independent verification of qualifications is not possible from public sources.

## 3. Circle Methodology: Origins and Analysis

### What Is the Circle Tradition?
The "circle" or "council" methodology in education has multiple roots:
- **Way of Council** — Developed by Jack Zimmerman and Virginia Coyle at the Ojai Foundation (California), drawing on Native American talking circle traditions
- **Restorative Justice Circles** — Used in schools for conflict resolution, community building
- **Talking Circles** — Broader practice using a talking piece (stick, stone) passed around a circle, ensuring each person speaks without interruption

### How Does חכמת המעגל Fit?
The program uses the following recognizable elements from the circle tradition:
- **Speaking stick (מקל דיבור)** — A physical object passed around the circle; only the holder may speak
- **Circle seating** — All participants sit in a circle with no hierarchy
- **Equal voice** — "Each child has a place in the circle and the right to be different and unique"
- **Transition from competition to cooperation** — Core value
- **Reflective dialogue** — Structured sharing, active listening

### Connection to Israeli "Way of Council" Movement?
Israel has an established Way of Council community:
- **עמותת מעגל הקשבה** (Listening Circle Association) — Founded by Ronit Rinit, affiliated with Ojai Foundation
- **מרכז אוריאל** (Uriel Center) — Founded 2001 by Nuria and Eiran Levy, trains circle facilitators
- **No evidence of direct connection** between Michael Sela Abraham and either of these organizations

### Is This Laitman/Kabbalah?
A book titled "חכמת המעגל" was published by **Michael Laitman** (Bnei Baruch Kabbalah movement). This book describes workshop methods for "revealing the Creator through shared desire."

**Finding: NO connection detected.** The Mayim VeSela program and the Laitman book share only a name. The Mayim VeSela content is secular SEL methodology with no Kabbalistic content visible in any materials reviewed. Different author (מיכאל סלע vs. מיכאל לייטמן), different publisher, different methodology.

## 4. Is This a Sole Proprietor? Business Structure

### Confirmed: Sole Proprietorship (עוסק מורשה)
- **Business number:** 21390919
- **Business name:** סלע אברהם מיכאל — מים וסלע
- **Legal structure:** Licensed business operator (osek mursheh), NOT an amuta (registered association) or company (חברה בע"מ)
- **Not found on GuideStar Israel** — Consistent with being a sole proprietorship rather than an amuta
- **AllJobs profile says 11-50 employees** — Suggests a moderate operation with field instructors

### Implications of Sole Proprietorship
- **No transparency requirements** — Unlike amutot, sole proprietors do not publish annual financial reports, board member lists, or government service details on GuideStar
- **No public board or governance** — All decisions rest with the owner
- **Financial opacity** — Revenue, government funding received, and profit margins are not publicly accessible
- **Common pattern** — This is the same structure used by Mind Lab, Maga BeTiaum, and Meyda Amin (previously researched entities that also operate as sole proprietorships within the Gefen system)

## 5. Program Content: Ideological Analysis

### Values Explicitly Promoted
From the website and Gefen catalog:
- **Cooperation over competition** — Repeated as a core principle
- **Inclusion** — "Each child has a place in the circle"
- **Empathy and emotional intelligence**
- **Social responsibility** — Described as a program goal
- **Sustainability and environmental awareness** (in המעגל השלם / program #26623)
- **Social activism and entrepreneurship** (in המעגל השלם / program #26623)
- **"Living in partnership"** — Described as a way of life philosophy

### Ideological Red Flags / Notable Elements
| Element | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|
| Social justice language | Moderate — "social responsibility," "social activism," "inclusion" are present but framed as generic SEL, not critical theory |
| Gender/sexuality content | **None detected** — No gender topics in any reviewed materials |
| Political content | **None detected** — No partisan messaging found |
| Religious/spiritual content | **None detected** — Entirely secular framing |
| Climate activism | **Present** — המעגל השלם explicitly promotes climate awareness, sustainability, and prevention of "climate anxiety" |
| New Age/spiritual elements | **Low** — The "water and rock" symbolism (flow vs. stability, soul vs. body) has a mild holistic/spiritual flavor but is not prominent in the educational content |
| Critical pedagogy | **Low-moderate** — The emphasis on "cooperation over competition" and circle-based flat hierarchy aligns with progressive pedagogical philosophy but is not overtly political |

### The "Water and Rock" Philosophy
The business name symbolism (from the parent website maim-sela.co.il):
- **Water** = flow, change, renewal, creation, spirit, desire to move/learn/advance/connect
- **Rock** = stability, pause, reflection, body, desire to be present in "here and now"
- **Goal:** "Balance between opposing forces — body and soul, child and adult, inner and outer, self and society"
- **Mission statement:** "Wishing everyone the readiness and courage to walk the path of life and merge within themselves the different qualities in peace and love"

This language has a mild holistic/wellness tone but is not overtly ideological.

## 6. Financial Structure

### What We Know
- **Current contract scope:** 3 cities, 3 schools, NIS 30,000 budget
- **Business employs 11-50 people** (AllJobs data)
- **Gefen supplier** — Revenue primarily from school contracts through the Gefen catalog system
- **No public financial data** — Sole proprietorship, no GuideStar filings
- **Job listings indicate national operations** — Hiring in Negev region (Netivot, Bni Shemon, Ashkelon coast), suggesting geographic reach beyond Carmiel base
- **"15+ years, 500,000 children"** — If accurate, this represents substantial cumulative scale

### Financial Estimates (Speculative)
- A NIS 30,000 contract for 3 schools is modest per-school spending (~NIS 10,000/school)
- If the business operates in many cities simultaneously (as the 500K claim suggests), aggregate annual revenue could be significantly higher
- **Cannot verify without business tax records or obudget data** — No government transfer records found on obudget.org

## 7. Government Approval — Gefen Catalog Status

### Confirmed Gefen Programs
| Program | Gefen # | Type | Target | Status |
|---------|---------|------|--------|--------|
| חכמת המעגל | 5454 | ירוק (Green) | K-8 | Active |
| המעגל השלם | 26623 | Not specified | 3-12 + staff | Active |

### Second Gefen Entry: #16490
A search result also referenced Gefen #16490 for "חכמת המעגל" under "Educational Leadership" — focused on school teams and parents, covering "resilience and psychological wellbeing." This may be a teacher-training variant of the same program.

### What Gefen Approval Means
- The program passed Ministry of Education vetting for the Gefen catalog
- It is classified under recognized categories (SEL, life skills, school climate)
- Schools can use their Gefen budget allocation to purchase this program
- **Gefen approval does NOT imply endorsement of content quality** — it means the program meets formal criteria for inclusion in the catalog

## 8. Connection to Circle/Council/Restorative Justice Movements

### Summary of Ecosystem
| Movement | Israel Presence | Connection to Mayim VeSela |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Way of Council (Ojai Foundation) | עמותת מעגל הקשבה, Uriel Center | **No evidence of connection** |
| Restorative Justice Circles | Various school programs | **No evidence of connection** |
| CASEL SEL Framework | Ministry of Education adopting | **Program uses SEL language** |
| Laitman/Bnei Baruch "Wisdom of Circle" | Book published by Laitman | **No connection — name coincidence** |

The program uses the **language and techniques** of the circle tradition (talking stick, flat hierarchy, cooperative dialogue) but does not appear to be formally affiliated with any established circle training organization. Michael Sela Abraham appears to be an **independent practitioner** who has adapted circle principles into a branded educational product.

## 9. Risk Assessment Summary

### Risk Factors (supporting the 4/5 rating)
1. **Operator opacity** — No verifiable professional credentials, no public profile, no media presence
2. **Sole proprietorship structure** — No financial transparency, no governance oversight
3. **Unverifiable claims** — "15+ years, 500,000 children" cannot be independently confirmed
4. **Climate activism component** — המעגל השלם explicitly promotes climate activism and social entrepreneurship as educational goals
5. **Progressive pedagogical philosophy** — Cooperation-over-competition framework, flat hierarchy, "social responsibility" emphasis
6. **No clear training lineage** — Facilitator qualifications are unverifiable; no connection to established circle training institutions

### Mitigating Factors
1. **Gefen approved** — Multiple programs in the Ministry of Education catalog
2. **No partisan political content detected** — No evidence of party politics, NGO network affiliations, or advocacy campaigns
3. **No gender/sexuality content detected** — None found in any materials
4. **No religious/spiritual content detected** — Secular framework throughout
5. **No Kabbalah/Laitman connection** — Name coincidence only
6. **Established business** — 15+ years, AllJobs presence, multiple Gefen programs suggest a real operational track record

### Open Questions for Further Investigation
1. **What are Michael Sela Abraham's actual qualifications?** — Formal education, facilitation training, teaching certification?
2. **What is the actual annual revenue?** — Sole proprietorship opacity prevents verification
3. **Who are the 11-50 employees?** — What training do facilitators receive? The job listing mentions creative backgrounds (theater, movement, arts, mindfulness) but no formal SEL certification
4. **What happens in the actual sessions?** — The website describes methodology but not specific content delivered in classrooms. Parent observations or school evaluations would be more informative than marketing materials
5. **Is the climate activism component age-appropriate?** — "Social activism and entrepreneurship" as educational goals for grade 3+ may warrant content review
6. **Why no social media presence at all?** — For a business claiming 500K children served, the complete absence of Facebook/Instagram is unusual
