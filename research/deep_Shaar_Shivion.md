## Executive Summary

**Thesis:** שער שוויון (The Equalizer) is primarily a sports-for-social-change organization that uses soccer and basketball as tools for youth development in Israel's socioeconomic and geographic periphery. The organization is **NOT a subsidiary of JDC/Joint Israel**, contrary to claims in the previous cluster research. It is an independent registered association founded by Liran Gerassi in 2009 (registered 2012). While the organization does run female-specific programs (Boatot for girls' soccer, Female Empowerment basketball), its core mission is **coexistence and violence prevention through sports** -- bringing together Jewish, Arab, Bedouin, Druze, and immigrant children through shared athletic activity and academic tutoring. The feminist/gender classification appears to be a secondary characteristic, not the primary organizational identity.

**Key Corrections to Prior Research:**
1. **NOT a JDC subsidiary.** The prior report conflated שער שוויון with "סודקות את תקרת הזכוכית" (Cracking the Glass Ceiling), which IS a JDC program. These are separate entities.
2. **NOT "almost entirely foreign-funded."** Foreign donations are 28.7% of revenue -- significant but not dominant.
3. **The "44% unidentified revenue" claim requires context.** The 44.3% listed as "other" likely includes program fees, event income, and corporate partnerships (Tottenham Hotspur, Amidar, Decathlon, etc.) that do not fall into standard GuideStar reporting categories.
4. **The "41 schools across 5 cities" figure is outdated.** The organization currently operates 410+ teams across Israel, from Metula to Eilat, in far more than 5 cities.
5. **The budget figure of 780,495 NIS** from Gefen mapping represents only the enrichment program catalog entry, not the total organizational budget (which is 13.6M NIS).

**Risk Assessment Revision:** The prior classification as "Feminist/Gender-Agenda (risk: high)" overstates the ideological risk. A more accurate classification would be **"Sports-based social cohesion with gender-inclusion programs (risk: moderate)"**.

## 1. Organizational Structure & Legal Identity

### 1.1 Legal Entity
- **Name:** שער שוויון (ע"ר) -- Sha'ar Shivyon Registered Association
- **Original Name:** "The Israeli Sports and Education Initiative" (registered May 2012)
- **Name Change:** October 2021, renamed to שער שוויון
- **Registration Number:** 580558591
- **Legal Type:** Amuta (registered association)
- **Address:** Ben Tzvi Yitzhak 6, Hod HaSharon, 7537303
- **Field:** Sports
- **Status:** Active, proper management (Certificate of Proper Management 2022), Article 46 tax-exempt status (2024-2026)
- **Midot Effectiveness Badge:** Valid through 03/2026 (awarded by Midot/SFI Group)

### 1.2 Founding Story
The organization was founded in **2009** by **Liran Gerassi** (born 1985) while he was a student at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gerassi volunteered at a community center in Jerusalem's Talpiot neighborhood and observed youth engaging in destructive behaviors during after-school hours. He gathered them to form a soccer team, secured sponsorship for equipment, and paired athletic training with academic tutoring. The model proved effective -- teachers noticed improved academic performance, leading schools to adopt the framework.

- Started with 7 soccer teams from 7 schools in 2009
- Registered as NGO in 2012/2013
- Expanded to high schools in 2014
- Ministry of Education inclusion by 2017
- By 2020: 300 teams, ~4,500 participants
- By 2025/2026: 410+ teams, 10,000+ participants

### 1.3 Relationship to JDC/Joint Israel

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The prior cluster research report stated that "שער שוויון פועלת תחת ג'וינט ישראל" (operates under Joint Israel). This claim is **not supported by evidence**.

Evidence against JDC subordination:
- שער שוויון is registered as an **independent association** (amuta), not as a JDC program
- The organization's website, GuideStar listing, and obudget entry make **no reference to JDC**
- The founder (Liran Gerassi) is an independent social entrepreneur, not a JDC employee
- The board of directors has no identified JDC representatives
- Partners listed include: The Jewish Agency, Harris Philanthropies, Wingate Institute, Decathlon, Jerusalem Foundation -- but NOT JDC

**What was likely confused:** The program "סודקות את תקרת הזכוכית" (Cracking the Glass Ceiling) IS a JDC program. The prior research appears to have merged data from שער שוויון and סודקות into a single "feminist cluster" analysis, incorrectly attributing JDC connections to שער שוויון.

### 1.4 Scale of Operations
- **Teams:** 410+ across Israel
- **Participants:** 10,000+ children and youth
- **Employees:** 151 (2024)
- **Volunteers:** 500+
- **Geographic reach:** National, from Metula to Eilat
- **Cumulative impact:** 32,000 children since founding; 2,100 groups; 5,000 volunteer trainers; 850+ regional tournaments

## 2. Financial Analysis

### 2.1 Annual Revenue (2024 Reported)
**Total Revenue: 13,604,063 NIS** (sector median for sports amutot: 456,283 NIS -- organization is 30x the median)

| Source | Amount (NIS) | % of Total |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Foreign Donations | 3,908,146 | 28.7% |
| Israeli Donations | 2,059,241 | 15.1% |
| Government Services | 741,520 | 5.5% |
| Local Authority Services | 452,064 | 3.3% |
| Government Support (2025) | 386,240 | 2.8% |
| Local Authority Support | 33,750 | 0.2% |
| **Other (unspecified)** | **6,023,102** | **44.3%** |

### 2.2 Government Funding (obudget.org data)
**Total government transfers (3-year): 4,462,000 NIS**

Breakdown:
- **Ministry of Negev, Galil & National Resilience:** 4,461,999.90 NIS (Sports Services contract)
- **Development Authority (Negev, Galil & Cooperation):** 3,037,665 NIS (Community & Society Projects grant)

### 2.3 Analysis of the "44% Unidentified" Revenue

The prior research flagged the 44.3% "other" revenue as a red flag suggesting opacity. This deserves more nuanced analysis:

**Likely components of the 6M NIS "other" category:**
1. **Corporate partnerships** -- Amidar (public housing company, documented partnership), Decathlon (sporting goods), Wingate Institute
2. **International sports partnerships** -- Tottenham Hotspur (documented training event, 2022), UEFA (award-winning program)
3. **Program fees** from schools and community centers
4. **Jewish Federation funding** -- JUF (Jewish United Fund) documented as "longtime supporter"
5. **Jewish Agency** partnership (listed as partner on website)
6. **Harris Philanthropies** -- Josh and Marjorie Harris (Philadelphia 76ers co-owners) have given "in excess of $1 million" to the 48ers program since 2015
7. **Event fundraising** -- memorabilia auctions, tournaments

The classification as "unidentified" stems from GuideStar's reporting categories not capturing corporate/programmatic partnerships separately. This is a structural reporting limitation, not necessarily a transparency failure.

### 2.4 Identified Foreign Donors

| Donor | Amount/Nature | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Charles H. Revson Foundation | $80,000 (2024 grant) | [Revson Foundation](https://revsonfoundation.org/grant/shaar-shivion-a-r/) |
| Harris Philanthropies (Josh & Marjorie Harris) | >$1M cumulative since 2015 | [eJewishPhilanthropy](https://ejewishphilanthropy.com/the-76ers-josh-and-marjorie-harris-back-israeli-girls-basketball-initiative/) |
| JUF (Jewish United Fund, Chicago) | Undisclosed, "longtime supporter" | [JUF Israel Office](https://www.juf.org/Israel_Office/tmpl-Impact.aspx?id=442938) |
| Tottenham Hotspur Foundation | In-kind (player visits, tickets, visibility) | [Tottenham](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2022/july/proudly-supporting-the-equalizer-charity-in-israel/) |

**Assessment:** The identified foreign donors are **mainstream Jewish philanthropic entities and sports organizations**, not politically-motivated progressive foundations. There is **no evidence** of funding from New Israel Fund, Ford Foundation, or Open Society Foundations (these were speculated in the prior report without any basis).

### 2.5 Gefen Mapping Budget

The **780,495 NIS** figure from the Gefen mapping represents only the enrichment program component (Gefen catalog #5197), which covers after-school soccer and Boatot activities for elementary students in the Arab sector. This is a small fraction of the total 13.6M NIS organizational budget.

- Combats drowning (major issue in Arab/Bedouin communities)

**7. Bar/Bat Mitzvah Project** -- Listed on website, details limited

### 4.2 Curriculum Analysis

The actual educational content centers on:
1. **Academic tutoring** -- homework help, test preparation, coordinated with school staff
2. **Sportsmanship values** -- "Fair Team Trophy" at tournaments, no red cards policy
3. **Coexistence** -- bringing together children from different backgrounds through shared sports
4. **Violence prevention** -- keeping youth occupied in positive after-school activities
5. **Anti-racism** -- cross-cultural encounters through tournaments
6. **Self-confidence** -- physical achievement, team belonging

**What is NOT in the curriculum (based on available evidence):**
- Gender theory or gender identity education
- Intersectional feminism
- Critical pedagogy (Paulo Freire)
- Political activism training
- Anti-patriarchy messaging

The "gender empowerment" component in Boatot and Female Empowerment programs focuses on **practical self-confidence** (body image, physical capability, belonging) rather than ideological gender theory. This is closer to **traditional girls' sports empowerment** (like Title IX in the US) than to critical gender theory.

## 5. Ideology Assessment

### 5.1 Core Ideology
The organization's stated ideology is **sport-based social change**: using athletic activity as a common language to bridge social, ethnic, and economic divides. Key principles:
- Sport as "the great equalizer"
- Coexistence through shared experience (not through ideological education)
- "The field is the bridge"
- Equal access to development opportunities regardless of background

### 5.2 Is This Feminist/Gender-Agenda?

**The prior research classified this as "Feminist/Gender-Agenda (risk: high)."** This requires significant qualification:

**Evidence FOR gender focus:**
- Boatot (girls' soccer) and Female Empowerment (girls' basketball) are gender-specific programs
- The name includes "שוויון" (equality)
- The website mentions "gender equality" alongside social and geographic equality
- Gefen classification includes gender-related markers

**Evidence AGAINST primary gender ideology:**
- The flagship program (Sha'ar Shivyon) is **mixed-gender** -- boys and girls together
- The organization also runs programs for boys, special needs teens, and mixed groups
- The founder's origin story is about **violence prevention and coexistence**, not gender
- The main body of work (270 out of ~400 groups) is the mixed-gender flagship
- Gender-specific programs (Boatot + Female Empowerment) represent ~27% of groups (107 out of ~400)
- The "empowerment" described is sports-based confidence building, not ideological
- No evidence of gender theory, intersectional feminism, or critical pedagogy in curriculum
- The organization received a UEFA award for social change -- European football governance recognizing sports-based work, not gender activism

### 5.3 Political Positioning

**Apolitical positioning is plausible:**
- Works with both Jewish and Arab communities
- Operates in Bedouin, Druze, and mixed cities
- Post-October 7 context: continued Arab-Jewish programming during war (Israel21c reported)
- Post-May 2021: expanded to mixed cities (Lod, Haifa, Acre) after ethnic clashes
- Recognition from UEFA, Israeli Football Association
- Tottenham Hotspur captain Hugo Lloris: "It is clear that the charity does a fantastic job in bringing together Israeli and Palestinian children through the power of football"
- Israeli First Lady Michal Herzog participated in a tournament

**Potential concern areas:**
- The coexistence model could be viewed as normalizing/depoliticizing structural inequalities
- The Revson Foundation grant specifically funds "Arab and Bedouin communities" -- this is sector-targeted
- The "social change" language could evolve over time as the organization grows
- Any organization working in Arab-Jewish relations is inherently political in the Israeli context

### 5.4 Assessment: Pure Merit-Based vs. Intersectional

**More merit-based than intersectional.** The model is:
- Sport as equalizer (meritocratic -- performance matters on the field)
- Academic tutoring (practical, achievement-oriented)
- Coexistence through shared activity (contact theory, not ideology)
- Condition-based participation (you must behave well in school to play)

This is fundamentally different from a critical-theory approach that would frame society as oppressive and seek to create "agents of change."

## 6. Foreign Funding Chain

### 6.1 Documented Funding Sources

**American Jewish Philanthropy:**
- **Harris Philanthropies** (Josh & Marjorie Harris, 76ers owners): >$1M since 2015. Motivation: Sports as social change, Jewish philanthropy. NOT progressive political.
- **Charles H. Revson Foundation**: $80,000 in 2024 for Arab/Bedouin community programs. Revson is a Jewish life/education foundation, not a political advocacy funder.
- **JUF (Jewish United Fund of Chicago)**: Undisclosed "longtime supporter" through Partnership2Gether program. JUF is mainstream Jewish community federation, not a political entity.

**Jewish Community Organizations:**
- **The Jewish Agency**: Listed as partner. Government-chartered Zionist organization.
- **Jerusalem Foundation**: Listed as partner. Non-political civic development.

**Sports Organizations:**
- **UEFA**: Award recognition + likely funding
- **Tottenham Hotspur**: In-kind support (player visits, visibility)
- **Decathlon**: Corporate sponsor (sporting goods)
- **Wingate Institute**: Israeli national sports institution

**Government:**
- Ministry of Negev, Galil & National Resilience: 4.46M NIS (3-year)
- Local authorities: Various
- Ministry of Culture and Sports: Partnership on Boatot expansion

**Housing:**
- **Amidar** (Israel's public housing company): Partnership on soccer programs in public housing communities

### 6.2 Is JDC in the Funding Chain?

**No evidence of JDC funding to שער שוויון.** The prior research claimed "operates under Joint Israel (JDC) -- almost entirely foreign-funded." Neither claim is supported:
- No JDC mention on the organization's website, GuideStar, or obudget
- No JDC personnel on the board
- The confusion likely arose from the cluster analysis grouping שער שוויון with סודקות את תקרת הזכוכית (which IS a JDC program)

### 6.3 Foreign Funding Assessment

Total foreign donations: 3,908,146 NIS (28.7% of revenue)

**Identified foreign donors account for approximately:**
- Harris Philanthropies: ~1M+ NIS equivalent (rough estimate, $250K+/year)
- Revson Foundation: ~300K NIS ($80K)
- JUF: Unknown
- Remaining: Likely other Jewish community federations, European football organizations

**None of the identified foreign donors are:**
- New Israel Fund
- Ford Foundation
- Open Society Foundations
- Any BDS-adjacent organization
- Any known anti-Israel entity

The prior report's speculation about Ford Foundation, NIF, and Soros funding was **entirely without evidence** and should be retracted.

---

## 7. Corporate Partnerships

### 7.1 Documented Corporate Partners

| Partner | Nature | Likely Motivation |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Amidar (public housing) | Joint soccer program in public housing | CSR, tenant engagement |
| Decathlon (sporting goods) | Sponsor | CSR, brand visibility in sports |
| Tottenham Hotspur | Player visits, visibility | Club social responsibility program |
| Philadelphia 76ers (via Harris) | 48ers program funding | Owner's personal philanthropy |
| Wingate Institute | Training partnership | National sports development |

### 7.2 Tech Company Connections

The task brief mentioned Teva, Amdocs, SAP, Microsoft, Elbit as reported corporate sponsors. **No evidence was found for any of these companies' involvement with שער שוויון.** These may have been attributed from the broader "feminist cluster" analysis or from a different organization in the cluster.

### 7.3 Academic Partners
- **Tel Aviv-Yaffo Academic College** (המכללה האקדמית ת"א יפו): Documented partnership
- **College Network** (רשת מכללות): Listed as partner

---

## 8. Controversies

### 8.1 No Controversies Found
No controversies, legal actions, SLAPP suits, or public criticism of שער שוויון was found in any source. The organization appears to have a positive public image across the Israeli media spectrum (coverage in Ynet, Israel Hayom, Sport1, Times of Israel, Jerusalem Post, Maariv).

### 8.2 War-Period Activity
Following October 7, the organization continued operating and specifically maintained Arab-Jewish programming, which was positively covered in media. This suggests a genuine coexistence orientation that persists under stress -- an important test of organizational values.

---

## 9. Values Alignment Table

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Jewish/Zionist identity | 2/5 | Not explicitly Zionist but works with Jewish Agency; 48ers named after 1948. Coexistence model is implicitly Israeli-normative. |
| Traditional family values | 3/5 | No evidence of challenging traditional values; girls' programs focus on confidence, not ideology |
| Education quality | 5/5 | Academic tutoring is a core component; condition-based participation |
| Anti-racism | 4/5 | Core mission, but framed as coexistence rather than critical race theory |
| Gender ideology risk | 2/5 | Girls' programs exist but are sports-based empowerment, not gender theory |
| Foreign influence risk | 2/5 | 29% foreign funding, but from mainstream Jewish sources, not political |
| Transparency | 3/5 | GuideStar compliant, Article 46, Midot badge; but 44% revenue not broken down by source |
| Coexistence agenda | 5/5 | Core mission is Arab-Jewish encounters through sports |
| Political neutrality | 3/5 | Ostensibly apolitical, but coexistence work is inherently political in Israeli context |

---

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Who exactly comprises the 3.9M NIS in foreign donations?** Harris (~1M+) and Revson (~300K) account for ~1.3M+, leaving ~2.6M from unidentified foreign donors. Are these additional Jewish federations?

2. **What is in the "other" 6M NIS revenue category?** Likely corporate partnerships and program fees, but not publicly itemized.

3. **What is the actual content of the "social-values" sessions?** The 721,014 NIS in the Gefen mapping is for "social-values" programming. We know it includes anti-racism, coexistence, and sportsmanship -- but what specific materials are used?

4. **Has the curriculum content shifted over time?** As the organization has grown from 7 teams to 410+, has there been mission drift toward more ideological content?

5. **David Bernstein (International President) -- who is he?** Common name; requires LinkedIn/professional verification.

6. **Effie Rosenhaus (Honorary President) -- what is his background?** May provide insight into the organization's donor network.

7. **What is the relationship between Liran Gerassi's "Global GameChangers" organization and שער שוויון?**

8. **The Revson Foundation grant specifically targets Arab/Bedouin communities.** Does this create a demographic focus that could shift the organization's mission over time?

## 11. Comparison with Prior Research Claims

| Prior Claim | Evidence Status | Correction |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| "Operates under Joint Israel (JDC)" | **FALSE** | Independent amuta, no JDC connection found |
| "Almost entirely foreign-funded" | **FALSE** | 28.7% foreign; 8.5% government; 44% other (likely domestic mix) |
| "44% of revenues unidentified" | **MISLEADING** | Standard GuideStar "other" category; not evidence of opacity |
| "Feminist/Gender-Agenda (risk: high)" | **OVERSTATED** | Sports org with some gender programs; risk: moderate at most |
| "41 schools across 5 cities" | **OUTDATED** | 410+ teams nationwide, Metula to Eilat |
| "Budget: 780,495 NIS" | **PARTIAL** | Gefen catalog entry only; total org budget is 13.6M NIS |
| Possible Ford Foundation/NIF/Soros funding | **UNFOUNDED** | Zero evidence; identified donors are mainstream Jewish philanthropies |
| "Semantic displacement" of term "equality" | **SPECULATIVE** | Organization uses "equality" in context of equal access to sports/education opportunities |
| Connection to Paulo Freire critical pedagogy | **UNFOUNDED** | No evidence of critical pedagogy; model is sports-based, condition-based, achievement-oriented |
