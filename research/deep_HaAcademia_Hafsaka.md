## Executive Summary / Thesis

The Academy for Recess Sciences is a **one-person educational startup** founded by **Efi Meir (אפי מאיר)**, a Jerusalem-based author and game designer. The program trains older students as "social coaches" who lead creative, equipment-free games during school breaks, aiming to reduce loneliness, violence, and screen addiction. Despite the "leadership" (מנהיגות) keyword flag, **no ideological content was detected**. The "leadership" component refers strictly to peer mentoring — older students helping younger ones play games. The organization is **benign** in terms of values embedding: its content is about social games, empathy, inclusion, and anti-screen-time. The budget of ₪15,900 across 4 cities/5 schools is very small. The main structural concern is legal opacity — it likely operates as a sole proprietorship (עוסק) rather than an amuta, despite being listed as an amuta on one job site, and it does not appear on GuideStar.

**Risk assessment: 2/5 (downgrade from initial 3/5).** The "leadership" flag is a false positive. This is a small, personally-run play/games program with no political, religious, or ideological agenda detected.

## 1. What Is This Organization?

**Full name:** האקדמיה למדעי ההפסקה (The Academy for Recess Sciences / The Academy for Break Sciences)

**Also known as:** האקדמיה ללימודי ההפסקה (variant name on Holam/Toval platform)

**Tagline:** "הדור החדש של ההפסקות" (The New Generation of Breaks)

**Website:** [games-academia.co.il](https://games-academia.co.il/)

**Nature:** An educational startup/initiative focused on improving school recess through structured peer-led games. Not a traditional NGO or amuta. Appears to be a sole proprietorship or small company run by a single founder.

**App:** "Playlist Game" — available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playlistgamemob.app) and iOS. Contains 1,000+ social games and 500 conversation-starter questions.

**Commercial products:** Card game sets (₪120 per family set, 70 game cards + 70 question cards). Bulk discounts available.

---

## 2. What Do They Actually Do During Breaks?

The core model:

1. **Selection of student coaches:** Teachers identify older students — often specifically those who are socially isolated ("transparent" students) — to become "social coaches" (מאמנים חברתיים) or "break leaders" (מובילי הפסקה).

2. **Training:** These students are trained to lead creative games during recess. Games are:
   - Equipment-free (no special equipment needed)
   - Non-competitive (no winners or losers)
   - Simple (3-sentence instructions + demo video)
   - Original (developed by the Academy)

3. **Implementation:** Fixed activity stations during breaks, run by trained student coaches without teacher involvement. Coaches also identify isolated children and draw them in.

4. **Classroom extension:** Teachers can integrate the games into classroom instruction.

5. **Festival/event format:** Schools can host "game festivals" exposing all students to diverse games.

**Philosophy:** "We give them fishing rods, not fish" — the approach teaches students self-directed engagement rather than providing direct adult assistance. Break time becomes "life in miniature" — a practice ground for social skills.

## 3. Who Runs It? Leadership & Background

### Efi Meir (אפי מאיר)

**Role:** Sole founder and operator

**Location:** Jerusalem (per BizMakeBiz business listing)

**Contact:**
- Phone: 052-6926611 (website), 054-4753064 (Gefen catalog)
- Email: efi@academia.games

**Background:**
- Father of 4 children (ages ~24, 22, 20, 18 as of article date)
- Holds a **B.A. in Education**
- Previously owned a **production company** (חברת הפקה) — left it to found the Academy
- Published author: "התנ"ך שלא סופר" (The Bible That Wasn't Told), published by Yadiot Aharonot Books (July 2023, 350 pages, ₪54). Book endorsed by Rabbi Prof. Yehuda Brandeis (president of Herzog College). The book offers fresh, accessible, cross-denominational interpretations of biblical narratives based on hundreds of Jewish and scientific sources.
- Avid runner (claims to have accumulated enough distance to circle the Earth)
- Won **1st place** in social initiative competition by **Epoch Times magazine** (מגזין אפוק) in 2016

**Origin story (from Ynet):** One day, Meir came to his son's school and found him sitting alone during recess. The son had social difficulties and was integrated in a regular classroom. The image of the child "frozen" during break stayed with him. This motivated him to leave his production company and create the Academy. Quote: "The picture is still etched in my mind" (even a decade later).

**No other staff identified by name on the website.** The drushim.co.il (job site) listing claims 11-50 employees, but this figure is likely exaggerated or includes per-school facilitators/coaches. No evidence of a formal organizational team.

---

## 4. Does "Leadership" (מנהיגות) Embed Specific Ideological Content?

**Short answer: No. This is a false positive.**

The "leadership" keyword in the context of this program refers to:
- **Peer leadership skills** — older students learning to organize activities for younger ones
- **Self-confidence and initiative** — listed alongside concentration, emotional intelligence, social skills
- **"כושר מנהיגות"** (leadership capacity) — one of several life skills the games claim to develop

The full list of values/skills the program promotes:
- Self-confidence (ביטחון עצמי)
- Leadership capacity (כושר מנהיגות)
- Willpower (כוח רצון)
- Concentration (ריכוז)
- Emotional intelligence (אינטליגנציה רגשית)
- Social skills (מיומנויות חברתיות)
- Empathy (אמפתיה)
- Excellence (מצוינות)
- Acceptance of diversity (קבלת השונה)

**No political, religious, national, gender, or social-justice ideology was found anywhere** — not on the website, not in news articles, not in the Gefen catalog description, not in school implementations. The values are generic prosocial skills. The founder's book on the Bible is non-denominational and academic in nature, endorsed by a religious-Zionist institution (Herzog College), but this is entirely separate from the school program.

The Leon Family Foundation (קרן משפחת ליאון) references the Academy's approach in its educational practices collection — specifically in a "break time mediation" (תיווך זמני הפסקה) practice guide — but only as an external video resource, not as a partner or funder.

## 5. Financial Structure

### Budget in Gefen Context
- **₪15,900 across 4 cities, 5 schools** — this is a very small allocation
- Per-school cost: approximately ₪3,180

### Gefen Catalog Listing
- **Listed product:** "משחקים חברתיים בהפסקה (פלייליסט)" (Social Games During Recess — Playlist)
- **Cost in catalog:** Listed as "ללא עלות" (free) — this likely refers to the digital platform access, not facilitated program
- **Content type:** "סביבה מתוקשבת ללא תוכן" (digital environment without content) — meaning the Gefen-listed product is a website/app access, not a full in-person program
- **Approved for:** Academic year תשפ"ו (2025-2026)

### Commercial Products (Direct Sales)
- Family game card set: ₪120 (3 sets for ₪300)
- School/teacher/Zoom game sets (pricing not found publicly)
- Playlist Game app (pricing unknown — may be free or freemium)

### Legal Structure — Key Concern
- **Not found on GuideStar** — no amuta registration discovered
- **BizMakeBiz listing:** Listed under "אפי מאיר" in Jerusalem, in the "חינוך" (education) category — consistent with sole proprietorship
- **Drushim.co.il listing:** Classified as "עמותה" (amuta/NGO) with 11-50 employees — **this may be inaccurate** or refers to a future/planned registration
- **No company/HP number found** in any public source
- **Most likely structure:** עוסק מורשה (licensed sole proprietor) or small company, NOT a registered amuta
- **The discrepancy between drushim.co.il's "amuta" classification and the absence from GuideStar is notable** — either the org was deregistered, or the job site classification is wrong

### Revenue Streams
1. Gefen-funded school programs (facilitated)
2. Gefen catalog digital platform (free access)
3. Direct card game set sales
4. App (Playlist Game)
5. Workshop facilitation
6. Book sales (separate venture)

## 6. Government Approval — Gefen

**Yes, approved in the Gefen educational catalog** (הקטלוג החינוכי).

- **Catalog URL:** [ecat.education.gov.il/academia-games](https://ecat.education.gov.il/academia-games)
- **Approval status:** Approved for תשפ"ו (2025-2026)
- **Provider name in catalog:** האקדמיה למדעי ההפסקה
- **Listed product:** Social Games During Recess (Playlist) — digital platform
- **Target audience:** Teachers, Students

**Distribution channel:** Also available through **Holam (חולם)** — "חוויית למידה משמעותית" (Meaningful Learning Experience), which operates under the **Toval** educational services umbrella. Listed there as "האקדמיה ללימודי ההפסקה" (variant name).

**Also listed on Karusela** (קרוסלה) — a platform for educational programs.

---

## 7. Social Media Presence

**Minimal to nonexistent public social media footprint:**

- **No Facebook page found** via search (not indexed by Google)
- **No Instagram account found**
- **XPlace profile exists:** [xplace.com/il/u/efi2002](https://www.xplace.com/il/u/efi2002) — but profile content is dynamically loaded and not indexed
- **Google Play app listing:** Playlist Game App exists
- **BizMakeBiz business listing:** Active
- **No YouTube channel found** (though demo videos exist on the website)
- **No TikTok found**
- **No LinkedIn company page found**

This is consistent with a one-person operation that relies on the Gefen catalog and word-of-mouth rather than social media marketing.

---

## 8. Ideological Assessment

**No ideological content detected.**

This is a genuinely practical program about improving school recess through structured play. The values it promotes (empathy, inclusion, social skills, anti-screen-addiction) are universally accepted and not politically coded in the Israeli context.

**Specific checks performed:**
- Website content: Games, skills, testimonials — no political/religious/national content
- Founder's published book: Biblical interpretation, non-denominational, endorsed by religious-Zionist academic — does not connect to or influence the school program
- Ynet article: Personal story about lonely child, anti-screen philosophy, family values — no ideology
- School implementations: Afula (Yahalom), Ra'anana (Ziv), Surkis school, Beit Horon, Lakia (Arab Bedouin town) — **cross-sector reach** (both Jewish and Arab schools), which is a positive indicator
- Epoch Times award (2016): Epoch Times Israel (מגזין אפוק) is associated with Falun Gong internationally, but the Israeli magazine operates as an independent lifestyle/ideas publication. Winning their social initiative competition does not indicate ideological alignment — it's a general "social good" award.
- Leon Family Foundation: References the Academy's videos as a resource but does not fund or partner with it. The Foundation itself is a mainstream education-focused foundation.

**The "leadership" flag is definitively a false positive.** The word is used in the generic developmental sense (building leadership skills in children through peer coaching), not in any political or movement-building sense.

## 9. Schools & Geographic Reach

Known school implementations (from various sources):
| School | City | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| בית ספר יהלום | עפולה (Afula) | Kol HaGalil (2020) |
| בית חינוך ע"ש מ. סורקיס | רמת השרון (Ramat HaSharon) | School website (2023) |
| בית ספר זיו | רעננה (Ra'anana) | School gallery |
| School in Beit Horon | בית חורון | Website testimonial |
| School in Lakia | לקייה (Bedouin town, Negev) | Website testimonial |
| Schools in Modiin | מודיעין | Website |
| Schools in Negev region | קיבוץ יובל, מועצה אזורית בן שמן | Website |

**Gefen deployment:** 4 cities, 5 schools (current cycle)

The cross-sector deployment (Jewish secular, Jewish religious, Arab Bedouin) is a positive indicator for a program without ideological content.

## 10. Key People Mentioned (Non-Founder)

| Name | Role | Context |
|------|------|---------|
| **פרח בר כהן** | מנהלת בית ספר יהלום, עפולה | Praised the program, allocated resources |
| **מג'יד אלאסעד** | מנהל בית ספר בלקייה | "We see less violence during breaks" |
| **נריה הלוי** | מנהל בית ספר בבית חורון | "Children and parents are very satisfied" |
| **מיכלית דליות** | (unknown role) | "Genius, simple, and wise" |
| **שי פירון** | (former Education Minister) | "This is a revolution" — testimonial on website |
| **שרית שוסטר** | רכזת חברתית | Led initiative at Yahalom school |
| **הרב פרופ' יהודה ברנדס** | נשיא מכללת הרצוג | Endorsed Meir's book (separate venture) |

**Note:** The Shai Piron testimonial ("This is a revolution") is notable — Piron was Education Minister (2013-2015) from Yesh Atid. This is a personal endorsement, not an official ministry position.

---

## 11. Values Alignment Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Political neutrality | **Clean** | Operates in both Jewish and Arab schools; no political content |
| Religious neutrality | **Clean** | No religious content in program; founder's book is separate |
| Gender ideology | **Clean** | No gender content detected |
| National identity | **Clean** | No national/Zionist content |
| Social justice framing | **Minimal** | Uses "acceptance of diversity" (קבלת השונה) — standard pedagogical language, not politically coded |
| Anti-screen agenda | **Present but benign** | Core philosophy is reducing screen time through social play — mainstream parenting concern |
| Transparency | **Low** | Sole proprietorship structure, no GuideStar listing, no published financials |

---

## 12. Risk Summary

**Revised risk rating: 2/5** (down from initial 3/5)

**Risks identified:**
1. **Legal structure opacity** — likely a sole proprietorship without amuta transparency requirements. No GuideStar listing. Financial data not publicly available. (Low concern given the tiny budget of ₪15,900)
2. **One-person dependency** — entire program relies on a single founder. No evident organizational depth or succession plan.
3. **Drushim.co.il discrepancy** — listed as amuta with 11-50 employees, but no amuta registration found. This is either an error or a classification the founder chose on the platform.

**Risks NOT identified:**
- No ideological embedding
- No political agenda
- No controversial leadership connections
- No financial irregularities detectable at this scale
- No complaints, criticism, or controversies found in any source
- "Leadership" keyword is a false positive

---

## 13. Open Questions / Further Investigation

1. **Legal entity type:** Is this actually registered as an amuta? Or is it a sole proprietorship / company? The drushim.co.il classification and the actual GuideStar absence need resolution. A direct check of the Companies Register (רשם החברות) or the Amutot Register (רשם העמותות) could clarify.
2. **Epoch Times connection depth:** The 2016 award from Epoch Times Israel is noted. While Epoch Times Israel is not the same as the Falun Gong-affiliated international edition, the connection could be worth a surface-level check.
3. **Actual number of schools served over time:** The Gefen budget shows 5 schools, but the broader footprint (mentioned cities, testimonials) suggests more schools over the years, possibly funded through direct payments or other channels.
4. **Shai Piron endorsement context:** Was this given in a personal or official capacity? When exactly?
