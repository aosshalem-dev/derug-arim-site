## THESIS

The Israel AIDS Task Force (IATF) is a legitimate, well-established public health organization founded in 1985 that has evolved well beyond its original HIV/AIDS mandate into a broader "healthy sexuality" and LGBTQ advocacy organization. While its core public health mission is credible and has produced measurable results (e.g., the 2022 universal HIV screening for pregnant women), the organization operates with notable structural characteristics that warrant scrutiny: (1) it is the **sole national-level NGO** in its field, creating a monopoly position; (2) it has received **NIF (New Israel Fund) funding** since its founding; (3) it actively merged with the LGBTQ-focused "Bella Doeget" organization in 2002, making LGBTQ outreach an institutional function; (4) its 2019 strategic pivot toward "healthy sexuality" broadened its school-based education mandate beyond STI prevention into territory that critics see as gender/sexuality ideology; and (5) it operates in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog with a 5/5 rating despite a small budget footprint (37,100 NIS), suggesting it functions as a foothold program rather than a major revenue source. The organization's annual turnover (~3.8M NIS in 2024) is modest, its government funding is a small fraction of revenue, and it is heavily donation-dependent -- making it vulnerable to both financial crisis and donor-driven mission drift.

## 2. FINANCES

### Annual Turnover
| Year | Turnover (NIS) | Source |
|------|---------------|--------|
| ~2001 | 3,000,000 | Globes (Rami Hassman era; 8x increase) |
| ~2006 | 2,477,000 | Ynet health NGO survey |
| 2024 | 3,816,413 | obudget.org |

**Sector median (Health & Life-Saving):** 687,351 NIS -- IATF is approximately **5.5x the sector median**.

### Revenue Breakdown (~2006-2007 data, most detailed available)
| Source | Percentage |
|--------|-----------|
| Public donations (fundraising events) | 55% |
| Foundation grants | 12% |
| Self-generated income | 16% |
| Corporate/private donations | 8% |
| Government & municipal support | 8% |

A separate breakdown from a different report year shows:
- 67% public donations
- 22% public participation in service costs
- 8% institutional/contract payments
- 3% government support/grants

### Government Funding (from obudget.org)
**Total government transfers (3-year sum):** 176,612 NIS
- Contracts (התקשרויות): 87,806 NIS
- Support/grants (תמיכות): 88,806 NIS

**By Ministry:**
| Ministry | Amount (NIS) | Details |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Ministry of Health | 2,489,194 | Support for medical orgs (1.5M over 19 payments), retroactive AIDS committee payment (174K), shared HIV testing initiative (167K), condom/detection promotion (161K), other contracts (482K) |
| Ministry of Finance | 88,806 | Compensation fund for associations (2 payments) |
| Prison Service | 8,000 | AIDS awareness activities (3 contracts) |
| Youth Aliyah Administration | 5,400 | AIDS awareness services |

**Key observation:** Government funding is a **tiny fraction** of the organization's total revenue. The 2.49M from MOH appears to be a cumulative multi-year figure. The organization is fundamentally **donation-dependent**, not government-funded.

### Staffing (2024)
- **Employees:** 14
- **Volunteers:** 68 (previously reported as ~100-150 in other years)

### Known Corporate Donors
- **Gilead Sciences** -- Major pharmaceutical company; funds the "100% Connection 0% Infection" program and CARES COVID-19 support. Gilead partnered with IATF in 2019 specifically around HIV testing advocacy for pregnant women.
  - Source: https://www.gileadzeroingin.com/global-programs/israel.html
  - Source: https://www.gilead.com/en-il/responsibility/partnership-and-community
- **Bank Hapoalim** -- Previously a major donor; funding reportedly declined (mentioned in 2019 ha-makom article)
- **McDonald's Israel** -- Previously donated; funding reportedly declined
- **Y&R Israel** (advertising firm) -- Provides voluntary advertising services; one campaign received UN recognition
- **Ranni Rahav** (PR professional) -- Organizes annual art fundraiser with ~500 artists donating works
- **Igul LaTova** (Round-Up for Good) -- Micro-donation platform; 1,604 active participants, ~6 NIS/month average

### Financial Crises
- **~2003:** Organization was "nearly defunct" with a budgetary deficit when Dr. Gideon Hirsch took over as director
- **January 2019:** CEO Chen Shmulio sent a warning letter to Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman that the organization faced **closure** due to ~1 million NIS shortfall. MOH had reduced funding by ~70,000 NIS from 2017 levels and failed to transfer payments for joint projects. Programs for Ethiopian immigrants and drug users were frozen.

## 4. PROGRAMS

### 4a. Education Department ("Teen Talk" / "התנהגות מינית אחראית")
- **Operating since:** 1994
- **Scale:** Over 25,000 students annually
- **Gefen Program #1102:** "Responsible Sexual Behavior" (התנהגות מינית אחראית)
  - Rating: 5/5 (human review)
  - Deployed in: 5 cities (Beer Sheva, Herzliya, Haifa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv)
  - Schools: 6
  - Budget: 37,100 NIS
- **Stated goal:** "Provide reliable and current sex education, appropriate and comprehensive for diverse populations, so they can enjoy psychological wellbeing, optimal social and sexual relationships, and maintain healthy and safe sexual lives."
- **Content areas:** Healthy sexuality, contraception/birth control, STIs, adolescent sexuality, at-risk youth
- **Target audiences:** Teenagers, military recruits, students, young adults (20-30), adults (30-65), seniors, parents, educational staff, government entities
- **Delivery:** Experienced facilitators directed by the organization's educational advisor

**Critical observation:** The Gefen catalog budget of 37,100 NIS is **negligible** compared to IATF's 3.8M NIS total turnover. This appears to be a **foothold program** -- the Gefen listing grants institutional legitimacy and school access, but the actual revenue impact is minimal. The real question is what content is delivered in those 6 schools across 5 cities.

### 4b. "Bella Doeget" (בלה דואגת) -- LGBTQ Division
- **Origin:** Originally a separate organization; merged with IATF in 2002 following member vote
- **Function:** Information, awareness, and prevention work specifically within the LGBTQ+ community
- **Website:** https://www.beladoeget.org/
- **Activities:** Sexual health outreach, community clinics, awareness campaigns

### 4c. HIV Testing Services
- **Anonymous rapid testing** with mobile outreach units
- **Testing centers** in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Beer Sheva
- **Counseling** by trained volunteers

### 4d. Other Programs
- **Ethiopian immigrant community** -- Specific HIV awareness and prevention (reportedly frozen in 2019 due to budget cuts)
- **Asylum seekers and refugees** -- Academic publication: "ASSAF/Israel AIDS Task Force: Promoting Equal Rights for HIV-Positive Refugee Asylum Seekers in Israel" (published by Taylor & Francis)
- **Drug users** -- Harm reduction programs (historically controversial; in 1987 tried to distribute syringes against MOH policy)
- **Prison education** -- Awareness activities via contracts with Prison Service
- **IVF access for HIV+ individuals** -- Gideon Hirsch pressured Knesset to discuss women's IVF rights
- **PrEP advocacy** -- Approved in Israel 2017; IATF pushed for broader access per WHO guidelines
- **Universal HIV screening for pregnant women** -- Led decade-long advocacy; achieved policy change in September 2022

## 5. IDEOLOGY: HEALTH ORGANIZATION OR ADVOCACY VEHICLE?

### The 2019 Strategic Pivot
The most significant ideological shift occurred in **July 2019**, when CEO Chen Shmulio announced a strategic pivot from pure HIV/AIDS work toward **"healthy sexuality"** (מיניות בריאה). This was modeled on international sexual health centers.

**What happened:**
- The pivot was announced via a media interview, not internal communication
- Some board members claim they were **not invited** to the assembly vote approving the change
- Invitations should have preceded the meeting by 10 days under nonprofit law; some members say this wasn't followed
- Non-members allegedly received invitations while registered members did not
- Meeting minutes were not published despite requests
- Board member **Margelit Lorberbaum** and others raised objections

**Why it matters:**
The shift from "fighting AIDS" to "healthy sexuality" is exactly the pattern seen in other organizations where a specific public health mandate transforms into a broader social/ideological platform. Critics within the organization explicitly warned that HIV work would be deprioritized despite rising infection rates (400 new cases in 2018, second consecutive year of increases).

**Financial motivation:** Major donors (Bank Hapoalim, McDonald's) had withdrawn funding. Broadening the mission was seen as a way to attract new donors.

**Source:** https://www.ha-makom.co.il/post-tomer-change-vaad-shmilo/

### Hebrew vs. English Messaging
- **Hebrew website:** Focuses on HIV testing, treatment advocacy, rights of people living with HIV. The "Who We Are" page emphasizes being the oldest national AIDS organization.
- **English website:** More emphasis on "building a healthy community" framing; broader sexual health language.
- **Bella Doeget (LGBTQ arm):** Has its own website (beladoeget.org) focused specifically on LGBTQ sexual health -- this is the most explicitly LGBTQ-focused arm.

### LGBTQ Integration
The LGBTQ dimension is **structurally embedded** in the organization since the 2002 Bella Doeget merger. This is not incidental -- MSM (men who have sex with men) are a primary HIV risk population in Israel. However, the merger means that LGBTQ advocacy is now an **institutional function** of the organization, not merely a health outreach program.

### Connection to Sex Education Association (האגודה לחינוך מיני)
The IATF is listed on the website of the Sex Education Association (sei.org.il), an umbrella body for sex education organizations in Israel. This positions the IATF within the broader sex education institutional ecosystem.

### What Do They Actually Teach in Schools?
Based on available evidence, the school program content focuses on:
1. STI prevention (HIV and other)
2. Condom use and contraception
3. "Healthy sexuality" and safe sexual relationships
4. Psychological wellbeing related to sexuality

**What I could NOT find:** No publicly available curriculum documents, lesson plans, or specific content about gender identity, sexual orientation education, or LGBTQ-specific content in the K-12 school program. The Gefen program description focuses on "responsible sexual behavior" -- the question is whether this includes gender ideology content or is limited to STI/pregnancy prevention.

**Assessment:** The organization's school program likely focuses on STI prevention and safe sex rather than gender ideology per se. However, post-2019, the "healthy sexuality" framing opens the door to broader content. The lack of publicly available curriculum documents is a gap.

## 6. FOREIGN FUNDING

### Confirmed Foreign Funding Sources

| Source | Type | Evidence |
|--------|------|----------|
| **New Israel Fund (NIF)** | Grants | NIF explicitly claims credit for supporting the IATF since its founding. Avinof Frumer is described as founding "the NIF-supported Israel AIDS Task Force." NIF page: https://www.nif.org/stories/social-and-economic-justice/watch-avinof-frumer-the-trailblazer-who-made-sure-aids-patients-would-be-cared-for/ |
| **Gilead Sciences (US pharma)** | Corporate grants | Zeroing In program, CARES COVID fund. Source: https://www.gileadzeroingin.com/global-programs/israel.html |

### NOT Confirmed
| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Ford Foundation** | No evidence of direct funding to IATF found. Ford funds NIF, which funds IATF -- indirect pipeline possible but unverified. |
| **EU** | No evidence found |
| **US 501(c)(3) entity** | No "American Friends of Israel AIDS Task Force" entity found. However, the organization claims tax-deductible status in the US, UK, and France -- this likely means donations are routed through a fiscal sponsor (e.g., IsraelGives, PEF Israel Endowment Fund, or similar). |

### Key Finding: NIF Connection
The NIF connection is **documented by NIF itself**. This places the IATF in the broader NIF ecosystem of Israeli civil society organizations. NIF has provided over $350M to 950+ organizations since 1979. The IATF appears to be one of the earlier grantees.

## 7. CONTROVERSIES

### 7a. Syringe Distribution Standoff (1987)
In May 1987, the IATF announced it would begin distributing clean syringes to drug users, in direct defiance of Health Ministry policy. Health Minister **Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino** threatened a lawsuit. The IATF backed down, but media pressure eventually forced the MOH to change its policy.

### 7b. Condom Poster Ban (1999)
Health Minister **Shlomo Benizri** (Shas, ultra-Orthodox) ordered the **destruction** of World AIDS Day posters and pamphlets showing condoms. He called the imagery "embarrassing" and potentially "desecrating" Jerusalem's streets. Prof. Zvi Bentwich responded: "Apparently, his religious urges have overcome his senses."

**Source:** BMJ: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1117198/

### 7c. CEO Suicide (December 2008)
**Dr. Gideon Hirsch**, age 47, was found dead in his Jaffa apartment from pill overdose. He had been HIV+ for 20 years (diagnosed at Stanford), was Israel's first openly HIV+ medical student, and had rehabilitated the IATF from near-collapse. Both his parents also died by suicide. This was a significant organizational trauma.

- Jerusalem Post: https://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Sci-Tech/Health/AIDS-group-creating-fund-in-memory-of-courageous-director-who-committed-suicide

### 7d. Near-Closure Financial Crisis (2019)
CEO Chen Shmulio warned Deputy Health Minister Litzman that the organization faced closure due to ~1M NIS shortfall. MOH had cut funding and failed to transfer payments for completed projects. Ethiopian immigrant and drug user programs were frozen.

**Source:** Ynet: https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5452053,00.html

### 7e. Strategic Pivot Controversy (2019)
Internal governance crisis when the organization pivoted from "AIDS" to "healthy sexuality." Board members accused leadership of:
- Bypassing proper assembly procedures
- Not inviting all members to the vote
- Publishing meeting changes via media before internal communication
- Deprioritizing HIV work despite rising infection rates

**Source:** Ha-Makom: https://www.ha-makom.co.il/post-tomer-change-vaad-shmilo/

### 7f. Rising HIV Rates Despite Organization's Existence
- ~8,700 people living with HIV in Israel (2017)
- 405 new HIV cases in 2017 (increase over prior year)
- 400 new cases in 2018 (second consecutive year of increases)
- However: **22% decrease in new cases reported in 2024** (Times of Israel, World AIDS Day report)

**Source:** https://www.timesofisrael.com/on-world-aids-day-health-ministry-reports-22-decrease-of-new-hiv-cases-in-2024/

## RISK SUMMARY & OPEN QUESTIONS

### Key Risks
1. **Monopoly position:** As the "only national-level NGO" in AIDS, it faces no competitive accountability
2. **Mission creep:** The 2019 pivot from AIDS to "healthy sexuality" is textbook mission drift, potentially using the HIV mandate as cover for broader sex education ideology
3. **NIF funding pipeline:** Confirmed NIF grantee since founding. Amounts and conditions unknown.
4. **Pharmaceutical conflicts:** Gilead (maker of HIV drugs including PrEP) is a major funder. This creates an inherent conflict of interest -- the organization advocates for broader PrEP access while funded by the PrEP manufacturer.
5. **School program opacity:** The Gefen program reaches students but curriculum content is not publicly documented

### Open Questions for Further Investigation
1. **What exactly is taught in the 6 schools under program #1102?** No curriculum documents are publicly available. A parent or school board member would need to request the actual lesson plans.
2. **What is the current NIF funding level?** NIF claims the IATF as a historical grantee but current amounts are unclear.
3. **Who are the current board members?** GuideStar's people page renders via JavaScript and could not be scraped. This requires manual lookup.
4. **What is the Gilead funding amount?** Gilead's grantee list PDF exists but specific amounts per organization are likely not disclosed.
5. **What happened after the 2019 strategic pivot?** Did the organization actually rebrand? The website still uses "הוועד למלחמה באיידס" but English messaging has shifted.
6. **Does the school program include LGBTQ content?** The Bella Doeget arm focuses on LGBTQ communities, but it's unclear whether this content enters the K-12 Gefen program.
7. **Is there a US fiscal sponsor or "Friends of" entity?** The organization claims US tax-deductibility but no dedicated 501(c)(3) entity was found.
