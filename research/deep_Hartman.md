## EXECUTIVE THESIS

The Shalom Hartman Institute is the most significant institutional bridge between Israeli liberal-religious thought and the North American Jewish establishment. Founded as an academic research institute, it has evolved into something far more consequential: a values-formation pipeline that shapes how IDF officers understand Jewish identity, how Israeli public school students encounter Judaism, how North American rabbis frame Israel for their congregations, and how policymakers think about religion-state relations. With combined Israel-US revenue exceeding $120 million annually and direct educational access to 1,000+ senior IDF officers per year, 75+ Israeli schools, and thousands of diaspora Jewish leaders, Hartman does not merely study Jewish pluralism -- it operationalizes it at institutional scale.

The CLAWS Foundation paradox -- receiving $25M+ from the same donors who funded Kohelet's judicial overhaul -- reveals not corruption but rather the ideological complexity of mega-donor philanthropy, where libertarian billionaires fund both sides of Israel's culture war simultaneously.

## 4. IDEOLOGY & PROGRAMS

### Core Ideology: "Pluralistic Judaism"
The Hartman Institute's core intellectual product is a specific definition of Jewish pluralism that:
1. Treats all Jewish denominations (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, secular) as legitimate expressions of Judaism
2. Asserts that democracy and Judaism are not just compatible but mutually reinforcing
3. Frames Zionism as requiring ethical engagement with Palestinian rights
4. Advocates for separation of religion and state in key areas (marriage, conversion, Shabbat)
5. Rejects both ultra-Orthodox monopoly on religious affairs AND full secularization

### Semantic Analysis: How Hartman Redefines Key Terms

**"Zionism"** -- Hartman redefines this away from both right-wing nationalist Zionism and anti-Zionist critiques. Their Zionism is explicitly liberal, democratic, and ethically bound. The iEngage curriculum asks "why a Jewish state is necessary" -- framing the question as requiring justification rather than being self-evident.

**"Judaism"** -- Treated as an evolving intellectual tradition rather than fixed halakhic law. David Hartman's legacy explicitly challenges Orthodox fundamentalism while remaining engaged with traditional texts.

**"Pluralism"** -- Their Hebrew site defines this in democratic terms: "הכרה בערך של קיומן של דעות, של השקפות שונות" (recognition of the value of different opinions and worldviews). In practice, this means treating Reform and Conservative Judaism as equal to Orthodoxy -- a position that is radical in the Israeli context where the Chief Rabbinate has a monopoly.

### Hebrew vs. English Messaging Comparison

**English site** (hartman.org.il): Emphasizes "enriching moral and spiritual life," "pluralism," "Israel's Jewish and democratic character," and "rebuilding the covenant between Israel and the Jewish world." Framing is warm, inclusive, aimed at diaspora Jewish donors and leaders.

**Hebrew site** (heb.hartman.org.il): Describes itself as "מרכז פלורליסטי למחקר, להגות, ולחינוך יהודי" (pluralistic center for research, thought, and Jewish education). The Hebrew framing is more direct about challenging the religion-state status quo: the Center for Judaism and State Policy explicitly works to "reshape policies" on marriage, conversion, Shabbat. The Israeli audience gets the policy-change agenda; the English audience gets the values-and-education framing.

**Key difference:** The English site has the "Center for Shared Society" (Jewish-Palestinian Israeli democracy) prominently listed. This is aimed at liberal diaspora audiences who care about Palestinian rights. The Hebrew site frames similar work through the lens of Israeli civic identity rather than Palestinian solidarity.

### Key Programs

#### iEngage (North America)
- Video and podcast curricula for Jewish thought leaders
- Addresses: why a Jewish state is necessary, how power should be exercised, why diaspora Jews should care about Israel
- Used in synagogues, campus programs, community education
- Notable output: *Speaking iEngage* book (Hartman, Becker, Klein Halevi, Kurtzer)
- **Assessment:** This is the primary vehicle for shaping how North American rabbis and Jewish educators talk about Israel. It occupies the center-left of American Jewish discourse.

#### Be'eri Initiative (Israel)
- Pluralistic Jewish-Israeli identity education in public schools
- Active in 75+ Israeli public middle and high schools
- 10 local authorities adopted it as municipal-wide program
- Works with Ministry of Education cooperation
- Teachers trained, curricula developed, professional development
- One-third of Israeli schools exposed to Be'eri materials
- **Assessment:** This is the most significant vector for Hartman's influence on Israeli society. Through Be'eri, their definition of pluralistic Judaism enters the secular Israeli school system as quasi-official curriculum.

#### Lev Aharon (IDF)
- Mandatory enrichment for IDF officers receiving promotion to Major
- Also seminars for Lieutenant Colonels and full Colonels
- 1,000+ senior officers per year participate
- Three days at Hartman Institute as part of two-week enrichment
- Content: Jewish identity, Israeli identity, religious pluralism, morality in military leadership
- 25+ cohorts completed
- **Assessment:** This is perhaps Hartman's most strategically important program. It gives them direct ideological access to the IDF officer corps, shaping how senior military leaders understand Jewish identity and ethical military conduct.

#### Muslim Leadership Initiative (MLI)
- 13-month fellowship for North American Muslim leaders
- Academic study, Israel site visits, US programs
- Faculty includes Yossi Klein Halevi, Tal Becker
- Controversial (see Section 6)

#### Center for Judaism and State Policy
- Directly supports Knesset members and policymakers
- Works on: civil marriage legislation, conversion reform, Shabbat in public sphere, "who is a Jew"
- Advances liberal/pluralistic agenda through advocacy, research, public campaigns
- **Assessment:** This is an explicitly political operation, not just academic. They are actively trying to change Israeli law on religion-state matters.

#### High Schools
- Midrashiya (girls) and Charles E. Smith (boys) in Jerusalem
- 700+ students
- Model schools demonstrating pluralistic Jewish education in practice

#### Rabbinic Programs
- Enrichment programs for rabbis from all denominations
- Melamdim Graduate School for Teacher Education
- Community Leadership Program (CLP)

## 5. GOVERNMENT TIES & INFLUENCE

### Direct Government Funding
- **Ministry of Education:** NIS 15,753,593 (largest government relationship)
- **Ministry of Settlement:** NIS 834,593
- **Ministry of Culture & Sport:** NIS 286,826
- **Ministry of Foreign Affairs:** NIS 232,628
- **Ranked 6th** among educational program organizations in Israel by revenue

### Influence Mechanisms

#### IDF Officer Training (Lev Aharon)
The most direct government influence mechanism. By being embedded in the IDF promotion process, Hartman's pluralistic Jewish values are literally a requirement for advancement to Major and above. Over 25 years, this means tens of thousands of senior officers have been exposed to Hartman's framework. This is unparalleled access for any think tank or educational institution.

#### Ministry of Education Partnership (Be'eri)
The Be'eri program operates "in cooperation and coordination with the Ministry of Education." When an NGO's curriculum is used in one-third of public schools, the line between independent education and state-adopted ideology becomes blurred. The NIS 15.7M from the Ministry is the financial expression of this partnership.

#### Advisory Access to Politicians
- **Micah Goodman** served as unofficial philosophical advisor to PM Naftali Bennett; his "shrinking the conflict" framework became actual government policy
- **Tal Becker** served as Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and helped draft the Abraham Accords
- The Center for Judaism and State Policy "directly supports leading members of Knesset, policymakers, influencers, and activists"

#### International Influence
- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pays NIS 232,628 for "educational materials for diaspora communities" -- indicating the government itself uses Hartman as a diaspora-relations tool
- iEngage shapes how thousands of North American rabbis frame Israel for their congregations
- Programs in London (LSJS partnership), Toronto, and across North America
- Content library of 3,500+ articles, videos, and podcasts

### Assessment: Government Relationship
Hartman occupies a unique position as both recipient of government funding AND critic of government policy. They receive NIS 15.7M from the Ministry of Education while simultaneously operating a center that lobbies to change Israeli law on religion-state matters. This dual role -- inside the system but advocating for system change -- is their strategic genius and their political vulnerability.

## 6. LEGAL ACTIONS & CONTROVERSIES

### CLAWS Foundation Dual Funding (Major Controversy)

**The Facts:**
- CLAWS Foundation donated $25M+ to Hartman (2010-2020), typically $3.25M/year
- CLAWS is controlled by Jeffrey Yass (net worth $65B) and Arthur Dantchik ($7B), co-founders of Susquehanna International Group
- The same CLAWS Foundation and its network funded the Kohelet Policy Forum, which designed Israel's judicial overhaul plan
- Funding to Kohelet flowed through intermediaries: CLAWS -> Silver Valley Research Foundation -> Central Fund of Israel -> Kohelet
- Kohelet received $7.7M (2021) and $8.5M (2022) through this route
- Dantchik donated approximately $220 million to CLAWS (2013-2020), with $110M in 2020 alone

**The Paradox:**
Hartman advocates for liberal democracy and pluralism; Kohelet advocates for judicial weakening and conservative-libertarian policies. The same billionaires funded both. In some years, CLAWS accounted for one-third to one-half of Hartman's private US fundraising.

**Hartman's Response:**
Donniel Hartman called CLAWS donors "very good friends" and insisted they had "no influence on the agenda." He stated: "Our record speaks for itself."

**Resolution:**
In August 2023, Arthur Dantchik announced he was cutting funding to Kohelet, citing "danger to future of Israel democracy." It is unclear whether CLAWS funding to Hartman continued after the controversy.

**Analysis:**
This is not a case of donor capture or ideological corruption. Yass and Dantchik are libertarians who support both educational pluralism (Hartman) and deregulation/judicial reform (Kohelet). The uncomfortable truth is that mega-donors often fund institutions across the ideological spectrum. However, the scale of CLAWS dependence ($3.25M/year in an organization with $11-24M revenue) represents a concentration risk that any governance expert would flag. The 4-star Charity Navigator rating notes 100% board independence, which mitigates concerns -- but financial dependence on a single donor family is distinct from board independence.

### Muslim Leadership Initiative (MLI) Controversy

**Critics include:**
- Jewish Voice for Peace: Accused MLI of "faithwashing" the occupation
- BDS movement supporters: MLI "undermines Muslim solidarity with Palestine"
- Former participants: Some publicly disassociated, calling it "divisive and harmful"
- Palestinian activists (Ali Abunimah): Conflation of Judaism and Zionism
- Petition campaign calling for MLI's halt
- Criticism that program is funded by groups accused of supporting Islamophobia

**Hartman's response:** FAQ page defending the program; continued operation

- Mondoweiss analysis: https://mondoweiss.net/2015/04/faithwashing-leadership-institute/

### Orthodox/Haredi Criticism
No major organized public campaign against Hartman was found from Orthodox/Haredi institutions, Im Tirtzu, or NGO Monitor. This is notable -- it suggests Hartman operates in a space that the Israeli right has not prioritized for attack, possibly because:
1. Hartman's IDF program is too embedded in the defense establishment to challenge
2. The institute's academic framing provides cover
3. Government funding creates political protection
4. The right's attention has been focused on more adversarial organizations (B'Tselem, Breaking the Silence)

### Academic vs. Advocacy Tension
The institute describes itself as a "research center" while simultaneously operating:
- A lobbying center (Judaism and State Policy)
- A values-formation pipeline (iEngage, Be'eri, Lev Aharon)
- Political advisory relationships (Goodman-Bennett)

This is not unusual for think tanks (Brookings, Heritage Foundation do the same), but it means claims of pure academic neutrality should be understood in context.

## KEY OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **CLAWS post-2020:** Did CLAWS Foundation donations to Hartman continue after the 2023 Forward/Haaretz expose? What replaced this revenue if it stopped? The FY 2023 US revenue spike to $34.5M followed by FY 2024 decline to $24.8M may reflect transition.

2. **Be'eri curriculum content:** What specifically is taught? The actual textbooks and lesson plans are not publicly available in English. An analysis of the Hebrew-language Be'eri materials would reveal whether the "pluralistic" framing is genuinely multi-perspective or tilted.

3. **IDF Lev Aharon syllabus:** What exactly do 1,000+ officers per year study for three days? This is arguably the most consequential educational program in Israeli civil-military relations, yet its content is not transparent.

4. **Micah Goodman's ongoing advisory role:** After the Bennett government fell, does Goodman continue to advise political figures? His influence on the "shrinking the conflict" concept has outlasted the Bennett government.

5. **Center for Judaism and State Policy -- legislative achievements:** Which specific bills or policy changes can be attributed to this center's work? Lobbying disclosure in Israel is less rigorous than in the US.

6. **Hebrew vs. English content gap:** A systematic comparison of Hebrew-language and English-language publications would reveal whether Hartman presents different messages to Israeli vs. diaspora audiences (initial indicators suggest yes -- the policy-change agenda is more explicit in Hebrew).

7. **Post-October 7 institutional response:** How has the Gaza war affected Hartman's programming, donor base, and internal intellectual consensus? Donniel Hartman's public statements suggest a "support the war but demand ethics" position -- is this the institutional consensus?

8. **Kohelet defunding aftereffects:** Did Dantchik's withdrawal from Kohelet increase his giving to Hartman? The timing of the revenue fluctuations is suggestive.
