# Deep Research: Sexual Assault Support Centers Network in Israel
## מרכזי סיוע לנפגעות תקיפה מינית — "יחד בהסכמה" (Together in Consent)

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Gefen Programs:** #2032 (R4, Sharon), #2370 (R4, Jerusalem), #1121 (R5, Haifa), #13483 (R4, Tel Aviv), #1502 (R3, Kiryat Shmona)
**Combined Gefen budget:** 192,176 NIS across 6 cities, 24 schools

## Executive Summary / Thesis

The "Together in Consent" (יחד בהסכמה) school programs operating in Israel's Gefen catalog are run by individual branches of a **9-center national network** of rape crisis centers, federated under the **Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel (ARCCI / איגוד מרכזי הסיוע לנפגעות ולנפגעי תקיפה מינית בישראל)**. Each center is a **separate legal entity** (registered amuta) with its own GuideStar number, board, and budget — but they coordinate nationally through ARCCI, which serves as the umbrella body. The network's combined annual revenue exceeds **113 million NIS** (all centers + umbrella), with heavy government funding from the Ministry of Welfare. The school program itself is a **prevention/education** arm of what are primarily **crisis-response** organizations. The 192,176 NIS Gefen budget is a tiny fraction of the network's total operation. The network has deep roots in Israeli feminism, was historically funded by the **New Israel Fund**, and currently receives grants from US Jewish foundations (Hadassah Foundation, Jewish Foundation LA, UJA-Federation). No significant controversy was found specifically about the "Together in Consent" program content, though broader sex education in Israel faces ongoing tension between secular and religious communities.

## 3. Finances

### Sector Overview (obudget.org)

The entire sexual assault support sector in Israel (20 organizations) reports:
- **Total annual revenue:** ~113.2 million NIS
- **Direct government funding (3-year):** ~29.9 million NIS
- **Total employees:** 351
- **Total volunteers:** 1,191

Source: https://next.obudget.org/i/reports/ngo-activity-report/סיוע%20לנפגעי%20תקיפה%20מינית

### Revenue of the Five Gefen-Active Centers + ARCCI

| Entity | Revenue 2024 | Gov Funding (3yr) | Primary Gov Funder |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ARCCI (umbrella) | 16,445,238 | 194,954 (all-time) | Ministry of Welfare (100K), Health (52K) |
| Sharon | 10,200,590 | 3,743,222 | Ministry of Welfare (8M cumulative) |
| Tel Aviv | 7,142,508 | 4,788,221 | Ministry of Welfare (12.7M cumulative) |
| Jerusalem | 5,824,535 | 5,478,602 | Ministry of Welfare (13M cumulative) |
| Haifa (HRCC) | 4,853,449 | 0 (last 3 years) | No recent government income recorded |
| Kiryat Shmona | 2,721,737 | 1,863,748 | Ministry of Welfare (4.5M cumulative) |

**Combined revenue of the 5 Gefen centers + ARCCI: ~47.2 million NIS (2024)**

### Key Financial Observations

1. **Ministry of Welfare dominates government funding** — it is by far the largest government funder for all centers, providing both "treatment services support" (תמיכה בשירותי טיפול) and "community services support" (תמיכה בשירותים קהילתיים).

2. **ARCCI umbrella has high revenue (16.4M) but minimal government funding (195K total all-time)**. This means the umbrella's income is overwhelmingly from **donations and philanthropic grants**, not government. The umbrella distributes funds to member centers and coordinates national programs.

3. **Haifa HRCC reports zero government income in the last 3 years** despite 4.85M revenue — suggesting it operates primarily on donations, fees, and foundation grants.

4. **Sharon center is largest by revenue (10.2M)** — ranked 4th by revenue in the sector, 1st in central district.

5. **The 192,176 NIS Gefen budget is minuscule** — less than 0.5% of the combined 47.2M revenue of the five operating centers. This is a token program relative to their main crisis-response operations.

### Foreign/International Donors

**Confirmed donors to ARCCI and member centers:**

| Donor | Type | Amount (known) |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **New Israel Fund (NIF)** | US-based foundation | Historical primary funder (early years). Current status unclear |
| **Hadassah Foundation** | US-based (Andrea Silagi Fund) | $25,000 (ombudsman training); $20,000 (post-Oct 7 discretionary) |
| **Jewish Women's Collective Response Fund** | US-based | $25,000 (post-Oct 7 awareness) |
| **Jewish Foundation Los Angeles** | US-based | Undisclosed grants |
| **UJA-Federation of New York** | US-based | Documented support (amount unclear) |
| **Dafna Fund** | Israel-based feminist fund | Research partnerships |
| **Igul LeTova** (Round Up for Good) | Israeli micro-donation platform | Ongoing (~10K participants rounding up purchases) |

**No evidence found of:** EU funding, UNFPA funding, UN Women direct funding, or specific European government grants to ARCCI or member centers.

**US Entity:** No evidence of a US-registered 501(c)(3) for ARCCI. Donations are channeled through intermediaries (JGive, IsraelGives, Hadassah Foundation, etc.).

## 4. Programs: "Together in Consent" (יחד בהסכמה / ביחד)

### Overview

The program appears in the Gefen catalog under slightly different names depending on the center. The Haifa center (HRCC) describes it as **"ביחד" (Together)** — a youth educational program for promoting "mutual sexuality" (מיניות הדדית) and preventing sexual violence.

### Program Structure (per HRCC documentation)

- **Format:** 3 sessions of 90 minutes each per student group
- **Setting:** Small groups, differentiated by age, conducted in schools and informal education settings
- **Target Population:** Elementary through high school students, at-risk youth, educational staff, and parents
- **Reach:** Professional instructors meet approximately **200,000 youth annually** across all centers nationally
- **Ministry of Education Approval:** Listed as approved Gefen program (#1121 for Haifa)

### Content Areas

Per the HRCC education page (https://www.hrcc.org.il/חינוך-הסברה-והכשרות/):

- **Boundaries in physical contact** (גבולות במגע)
- **Sexuality** — age-appropriate discussion of sexuality topics
- **Distinguishing flirtation from harassment** (הבחנה בין פלירטוט להטרדה)
- **Clear consent and social responsibility** (הסכמה חופשית ואחריות חברתית)
- Creates "an intimate and protected space enabling youth to raise the topic of sexual assault responsibly and with guidance"
- Includes **support infrastructure for educational staff** handling identified cases (i.e., if a child discloses abuse during the session, there is a protocol)

### How Does a Sexual Assault Center Run School Programs?

This is a deliberate strategic choice. The centers operate on a **prevention-to-response continuum**:

1. **Prevention** — school programs teaching consent, boundaries, and healthy relationships (the Gefen programs)
2. **Identification** — workshops sometimes surface disclosures from children who are being abused
3. **Crisis response** — the same organization provides immediate support, counseling, and accompaniment
4. **Treatment** — long-term therapeutic services for survivors

The school programs serve dual purposes: (a) primary prevention by educating youth about consent before they encounter situations of sexual violence, and (b) secondary prevention by creating safe spaces where existing victims may disclose and be connected to services. This model is standard internationally — RAINN in the US, Rape Crisis England & Wales, and similar networks all operate both crisis services and prevention education.

### Additional Educational Programs

Beyond the Gefen-listed "Together in Consent," the centers operate:

- **"First Person" (בגוף ראשון)** — sexual assault survivors share direct experiences with professional audiences (medical, legal, educational) to improve institutional responses
- **StandFor** — workplace sexual harassment prevention for organizations
- **Professional training courses** — 30-hour educator course (MoE continuing education credits), 56-hour therapist certification, community protection team training
- **KolMila** — anonymous chat/WhatsApp service for teens (~4,000 inquiries/year on sexuality, relationships, sexual orientation)

---

## 5. Ideology and Framework Analysis

### Feminist Foundation

The network is **explicitly feminist** in orientation. Key indicators:

1. **Leadership:** CEO Orit Sulitzeanu has a 20+ year career in feminist activism — former spokesperson for the **Israel Women's Network (שדולת הנשים)**, former chair of Gender Equality Committee at Hebrew University, member of **Kol HaIsha** (feminist organization)
2. **Founding history:** The earliest centers (Jerusalem 1981, Haifa 1981, Tel Aviv 1982) emerged from the **second-wave feminist movement** in Israel
3. **Initial funding:** The New Israel Fund was the primary early funder — NIF is explicitly associated with progressive/feminist causes in Israel
4. **Advocacy positions:** ARCCI publicly advocates for legislative reforms on sexual violence, campaigns against appointment of figures accused of sexual misconduct (e.g., Silvan Shalom), and submits reports to UN bodies
5. **Rappaport Prize:** Orit Sulitzeanu was recognized by the Rappaport Foundation for her work

### Consent Framework

The program uses a **consent-based framework** (rather than a "refusal skills" or abstinence model). Key characteristics:

- **Affirmative consent** — emphasis on "clear consent" (הסכמה חופשית), meaning consent must be actively given, not just absence of "no"
- **Social responsibility** — places responsibility on all parties to ensure consent, not just on potential victims to resist
- **Boundary awareness** — teaches recognition of personal boundaries and respect for others' boundaries
- **Flirtation vs. harassment distinction** — age-appropriate discussion of the line between acceptable social interaction and harassment

### Does It Include "Gender Ideology"?

**Based on available evidence:**

- The program content descriptions focus on **consent, boundaries, and violence prevention** rather than on gender theory, gender identity, or sexuality-spectrum topics
- The term "gender ideology" (אידאולוגיה מגדרית) does not appear in any of the program descriptions found
- The network does operate within a **feminist theoretical framework** (e.g., understanding sexual violence as rooted in power dynamics and gender inequality), but the school-facing program appears to be **practically focused** rather than theoretically ideological
- The KolMila chat service does handle questions about **sexual orientation** from teens, but this is a separate service, not part of the Gefen school program
- **No evidence found** of LGBTQ+ content in the "Together in Consent" program specifically

### Israeli vs. International Consent Education Models

| Feature | Israeli "Together in Consent" | US (e.g., RAINN/Speak About It) | UK (PSHE curriculum) |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Taught by | External professionals (center staff) | Varies — school staff or NGOs | School staff (mandatory PSHE) |
| Mandatory? | No — schools opt in via Gefen | Varies by state | Yes (since 2020) |
| Age range | Elementary–high school | Primarily college/high school | All ages (age-adapted) |
| Consent model | Affirmative ("clear consent") | Affirmative ("yes means yes") | Affirmative consent |
| Gender/LGBTQ content | Minimal/absent from program | Often included | Explicitly included |
| Operated by crisis centers? | Yes — integrated with support services | RAINN does both; varies | Separate from crisis services |
| Government funding | Minimal (Gefen = school budget) | Federal grants (OVW, CDC) | Core school funding |

---

## 6. Foreign Funding — Detailed

### US-based Jewish Philanthropic Sources

The ARCCI network receives funding from multiple US Jewish foundations, but this is typical of Israeli social-service nonprofits and does not indicate unusual external influence:

- **New Israel Fund** — documented historical primary funder. NIF "nurtured" ARCCI in its early years. NIF remains a listed partner. (Source: https://www.nif.org/tag/association-of-rape-crisis-centers/)
- **Hadassah Foundation** — multiple documented grants ($25K for ombudsman training, $20K discretionary, $25K collective response fund post-Oct 7). Grants underwritten by the Andrea Silagi Fund. (Source: https://hadassahfoundation.org/grant-recipient/the-association-of-rape-crisis-centers-in-israel-arcci/)
- **Jewish Foundation Los Angeles** — listed as a grant organization. (Source: https://www.jewishfoundationla.org/grant-org/association-of-rape-crisis-centers-in-israel/)
- **UJA-Federation of New York** — documented validation/documentation project support. (Source: https://www.ujafedny.org/news/va-rape-crisis-centers)
- **JUF (Jewish United Fund)** — documented sexual assault survivors project. (Source: https://www.juf.org/Israel_Office/tmpl-Impact.aspx?id=452897)

### International (Non-Jewish) Funding

**No evidence found** of direct funding from:
- European Union / European Commission
- UN Women or UNFPA
- European government bilateral aid
- Ford Foundation
- Open Society Foundation

### Domestic Israeli Funding

- **Government (Ministry of Welfare):** Dominant funder for individual centers (not umbrella). Cumulative government transfers to the sector: ~27.5M NIS (3-year period per obudget.org)
- **Igul LeTova:** Micro-donation platform (~10K participants)
- **Individual donors:** Via IsraelGives, JGive platforms

## 8. Controversies

### Specific to "Together in Consent" Program

**No specific controversies found** about the content of the "יחד בהסכמה" school program. No documented parent complaints, no media reports of objectionable content, no legal challenges.

### Broader Sex Education Controversies in Israel

The broader Israeli sex education landscape has significant controversies, but these are not specific to ARCCI's program:

1. **2013: Removal from religious schools** — All instruction about human reproduction was removed from the science curriculum of "state religious" (ממלכתי-דתי) public junior high schools. The Education Ministry asked publishers to eliminate chapters on reproduction, contraception, and STDs from religious school textbooks. (Source: https://www.deseret.com/2013/9/3/20524998/in-israel-sex-education-removed-from-junior-high-curriculum/)

2. **2024: Far-right legislative proposal** — Deputy Minister proposed barring teaching about sexual orientation before 9th grade. The Aguda (LGBTQ association) opposed this. (Source: https://www.timesofisrael.com/far-right-deputy-ministers-bill-would-bar-teaching-sex-orientation-before-9th-grade/)

3. **Religious community tensions** — 63% of children treated by social services for sexual abuse come from religious/Haredi families (1.4x their population proportion), yet these communities most resist sex education programs. (Source: https://www.ynet.co.il/judaism/article/rj1ybxwms)

4. **Optional status** — Sex education in Israel was not mandatory until recently. Starting 2023, the Ministry of Education announced mandatory sex education for all students, but enforcement and monitoring remain weak. (Source: https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/byjlcmmc5)

5. **Parental consent requirements** — Legislative proposals have required 75% parental approval for sex education lessons, with all students in the class needing to consent.

### ARCCI Political Advocacy (Not Education-Related)

ARCCI has taken public political positions that generated attention:
- **Opposed appointment of Silvan Shalom** as Israel Aerospace Industries chairman, calling it "a slap in the face" to sexual assault survivors. (Source: https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/politics/article/19666495)
- **Submitted report to UN** on Hamas sexual violence during October 7, 2023 attack. (Source: https://www.gov.il/en/pages/arcci-submits-first-report-to-un-21-feb-2024)
- **Regular media presence** — CEO Sulitzeanu frequently quoted in Haaretz, Ynet, Maariv on sexual violence policy issues.

### Statistical Context (2024 Annual Report)

ARCCI's 2024 annual report (presented to Knesset) documents:
- **51,000+ inquiries** received across all centers
- **12,757 new cases**
- **~4,000 additional teen chat inquiries** via KolMila
- **81% of sexual offense cases closed without indictment**
- **317 reports of drug/alcohol-facilitated sexual assault** (highest ever recorded)
- **30% increase in sexual offense reports from educational institutions**
- Only **28% of convicted sex offenders** placed in dedicated rehabilitation programs

---

## 9. Risk and Ideology Assessment

### Values Alignment Table

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Transparency** | HIGH | All entities on GuideStar, financials on obudget, annual reports published and submitted to Knesset |
| **Government accountability** | HIGH | Major government funding recipient, subject to oversight, Knesset committee appearances |
| **Feminist ideology** | PRESENT | Explicit feminist orientation in leadership and organizational mission. Consent framework rooted in feminist theory of power dynamics |
| **Gender ideology / gender theory** | NOT DETECTED in school programs | No evidence of gender identity, gender-spectrum, or queer theory content in Gefen programs specifically |
| **LGBTQ content** | MINIMAL | KolMila chat handles orientation questions, but not part of Gefen school program. Separate from "Together in Consent" |
| **Age-appropriateness** | NO CONCERNS RAISED | No documented complaints about content being too explicit for age groups. Programs are differentiated by age with small group formats |
| **Foreign influence** | LOW | Funding is primarily domestic (government + Israeli donors). US Jewish foundation funding is typical for Israeli nonprofits. No unusual foreign government funding |
| **Political advocacy** | PRESENT but SEPARATE | ARCCI umbrella engages in political advocacy (Knesset lobbying, UN submissions), but this is the umbrella org's function, not the school programs |

### Key Distinctions

1. **The school program is narrow; the organization is broad.** The 192,176 NIS Gefen program is a tiny prevention-education arm. The bulk of the network's 113M+ NIS operation is crisis response, therapy, hotlines, and legal accompaniment.

2. **Feminist orientation ≠ gender ideology.** The program is feminist in the sense that it frames sexual violence as a societal problem requiring systemic change, not just individual risk avoidance. But it does not appear to teach gender theory, gender fluidity, or queer theory in the school programs.

3. **Each center is independent.** The five Gefen programs are run by five different legal entities. Content may vary. The Haifa center (R5 rated — highest) appears to have the most developed educational arm.

---

## 10. Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Actual program content:** The Gefen catalog descriptions and HRCC website give overviews, but the actual lesson plans/materials have not been reviewed. Obtaining the specific curriculum would require requesting from the centers or the Ministry of Education.

2. **Why is Haifa rated R5 while others are R4 or R3?** What distinguishes the Haifa program from the others?

3. **WAVO (Nazareth) center:** This center serves Arab women — does the program content differ for Arab schools? How is consent education adapted for conservative Arab communities?

4. **Tahel (religious center):** Not in the Gefen list — does the religious/Haredi center offer school programs at all? If so, how does content differ?

5. **NIF current funding level:** Historical primary funder, but current grant amounts not publicly disclosed.

6. **ARCCI's 16.4M revenue composition:** With only 195K from government all-time, where does the remaining ~16.2M come from? Annual donor report not publicly accessible.
