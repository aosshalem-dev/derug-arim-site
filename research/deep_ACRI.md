**Research Date:** 2026-02-16
**Methodology:** Multi-domain deep research using WebSearch and WebFetch across Hebrew and English sources. Data cross-referenced from GuideStar Israel, obudget.org, NGO Monitor, HaMichlol, Wikipedia (Hebrew), ACRI official sites, news archives, and public registries.

## THESIS STATEMENT

ACRI is Israel's oldest and most institutionally embedded human rights organization, functioning as the legal-constitutional backbone of Israel's liberal-left civil society. Unlike single-issue NGOs (B'Tselem for occupation, Adalah for Arab rights), ACRI operates across the full spectrum of civil liberties -- positioning it as the indispensable litigation engine for challenges to government policy on everything from surveillance to minority rights to democratic erosion. Its strategic role is not merely advocacy: it is the primary mechanism through which European governments, the New Israel Fund, and progressive foundations channel resources into Israel's judicial-constitutional arena. The organization's trajectory from a universalist civil liberties defender (modeled on the ACLU) to an increasingly politicized actor that endorses the "apartheid" framework represents a significant ideological shift that has intensified under the current government's judicial overhaul.

## 1. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Legal Entities

| Entity | Registration | Type | Jurisdiction |
|--------|-------------|------|-------------|
| האגודה לזכויות האזרח בישראל | 580011567 | Amuta (registered association) | Israel, Registrar of Non-Profits |
| No confirmed US 501(c)(3) entity found | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Key finding:** Unlike many Israeli NGOs (e.g., Dror Israel's "Friends of" US entity), ACRI does not appear to maintain a dedicated US 501(c)(3) "American Friends of ACRI" entity. Instead, US donations likely flow through the New Israel Fund or direct donor-advised grants. The 2023 creation of an International Advisory Council (IAC) may be a precursor to establishing a formal US fundraising arm. [Requires verification -- ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer search yielded no direct ACRI US entity]

### 1.2 Offices

- **Headquarters:** Tel Aviv-Jaffa (since 2009; previously Jerusalem)
- **Branch Offices:** Jerusalem, Nazareth
- **Former office:** Be'er Sheva (mentioned in some sources but status unclear)

### 1.3 Organizational Departments

1. **Legal Department** -- Files petitions to the Supreme Court (HCJ), district courts, labor courts; appears before Knesset committees; sends legal letters to government ministries
2. **Education Department ("HaSadna" / הסדנא)** -- Teacher training, curricula in Hebrew and Arabic, anti-racism workshops, IHL education
3. **Public Engagement** -- Hotline for rights complaints, publications, media engagement, annual "State of Human Rights" reports
4. **International Advocacy** -- UN shadow reports, meetings with foreign diplomats, international media, INCLO membership

### 1.4 Staff

- **2006/7 data:** 47 staff members (Jewish and Arab)
- **2022 GuideStar data:** 36 employees, 2 volunteers
- **Membership:** Once had ~5,000 members (when Hedva Radovanitz headed Tel Aviv office); dropped to under 800 by 2010; current membership unknown

### 1.5 International Affiliations

| Network | Since | Nature |
|---------|-------|--------|
| International League for Human Rights | 1979 | Member |
| International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) | 1981 | Member (178-org network) |
| International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations (INCLO) | 2015 | Member |

**INCLO members:** ACLU (US), CCLA (Canada), CELS (Argentina), Dejusticia (Colombia), EIPR (Egypt), HRLN (India), HCLU (Hungary), ICCL (Ireland), Kenya Human Rights Commission, LRC (South Africa), Liberty (UK), Agora (Russia/international). This positions ACRI as the ACLU's Israeli counterpart in a global liberal civil liberties network.

### 1.6 International Advisory Council (IAC) -- Formed June 2023

US-based advisory body created to "build support for ACRI in the United States and beyond."

**Known members:**
- Robert Goldman -- Professor, Washington College of Law, Washington DC
- Michael Hirschhorn -- Human/civil rights nonprofit leader, Brooklyn NY
- Aliza Kaplan -- Professor, Lewis and Clark Law School, Portland OR
- Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum -- Senior rabbi, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, NYC
- Debra Katz -- Partner, Banks, Kumin, Washington DC
- Isabelle Kirschner -- Partner, Klayman, Rosenberg, Kirschner, NYC
- Noemi Masliah -- Principal, The Masliah Firm, NYC
- Lynn Paltrow -- Director, National Advocates for Pregnant Women, NYC

**Analysis:** The IAC is overwhelmingly US East Coast legal/progressive establishment. Rabbi Kleinbaum is particularly notable -- she leads the most prominent LGBTQ synagogue in the US. The composition suggests ACRI is building a US donor and legal advocacy network, likely in response to the NGO tax bill threat.

### 1.7 Organizations Spawned by ACRI

ACRI's model inspired the creation of specialized Israeli human rights groups:
- **Bizchut** (Disability Rights Center, 1992) -- spun off from ACRI

## 2. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Revenue Overview

| Year | Income (NIS) | Expenses (NIS) | Source |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 2016 | ~8,300,000 | N/A | HaMichlol/Wikipedia |
| 2018 | ~8,500,000 | N/A | Kol Zchut |
| 2022 | 9,600,000 | 9,300,000 | NGO Monitor / Registrar |
| 2022 | 10,872,286 (turnover) | N/A | obudget.org |

**Note:** The discrepancy between the NGO Monitor figure (9.6M) and obudget.org figure (10.87M) for 2022 may reflect different reporting scopes (donations only vs. total turnover including other revenue). The sector median for civil liberties organizations is NIS 2,637,694 -- making ACRI ~4x the median.

### 2.2 Foreign Government Funding (2012-2023)

**Total from foreign governmental bodies: NIS 27,123,700** (per Registrar of Non-Profits filings)

**Foreign government donations as % of total: 21.8%** (2017-2019 average)

#### Detailed Donor Breakdown (NIS, by year)

| Donor | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|
| European Union | 1,944,271 | 257,645 | 1,327,761 | 373,010 | -- |
| Bread for the World-EED (Germany) | 805,162 | 420,919 | 870,645 | 966,889 | 881,649 |
| Norway | 217,497 | 208,658 | 218,494 | 219,956 | 222,951 |
| Christian Aid (UK) | 64,907 | -- | 152,898 | 84,412 | -- |
| Sigrid Rausing Trust | -- | 705,334 | -- | -- | -- |
| Open Society Institute | -- | 371,700 | -- | -- | -- |
| Moriah Fund | -- | 358,414 | -- | -- | -- |
| Switzerland | -- | 307,315 | -- | -- | -- |
| Norwegian Refugee Council | 18,519 | -- | 100,210 | 207,409 | 68,865 |
| Friedrich Ebert Stiftung | 28,000 | -- | -- | -- | -- |

**Additional listed donors** (amounts not consistently available by year):
- Sweden (via Diakonia and Human Rights/IHL Secretariat)
- Netherlands
- Denmark (via Human Rights/IHL Secretariat)
- United States (Middle East Partnership Initiative -- MEPI)
- Oxfam
- Rosa Luxemburg Foundation (Germany)

### 2.3 New Israel Fund (NIF) Grants

**2017-2021 total authorized: $3,411,855** (~$682K/year average)

NIF is the single largest consistent funding pipeline. ACRI is described as NIF's "flagship grantee."

### 2.4 EU Funding (Recent Projects)

| Year | Project | Partner | Amount |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2023-2024 | "Always Watching: Protecting Human Rights in Digital Age" | Breaking the Silence | EUR 400,000 |
| 2023-2024 | "Influence: Normalizing Human Rights and Democracy through Popular Culture" | Center for Liberal Democracy | EUR 400,000 |

### 2.5 Israeli Government Transfers (obudget.org)

**Total all-time government transfers: NIS 13,081.71** (not millions -- just ~13K total)

This is essentially zero government funding. The transfers consist of:
- Ministry of Justice: NIS 12,704.71 (lectures, public committee membership, training sessions)
- Court Administration: NIS 377 (a single lecture)

**This is a critically important finding:** ACRI receives virtually no Israeli government money. Its independence from government funding is genuine but also means it falls under the 2025 NGO tax bill's targeting criteria.

### 2.6 Funding Source Analysis

**Estimated revenue composition (approximate, based on available data):**
- New Israel Fund: ~25-30% of annual budget
- European governments (EU, Norway, Germany/BftW, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands): ~25-30%
- Private foundations (Sigrid Rausing Trust, Open Society, Moriah Fund): ~15-20%
- Individual donations (Israeli and international): ~15-20%
- Church-based aid (Christian Aid UK, Bread for the World Germany): included in European above
- Israeli government: <0.2%

### 2.7 Revenue Trend

Budget has grown from ~8.3M NIS (2016) to ~10.9M NIS (2022), roughly 31% growth over 6 years. This represents approximately a 10% real increase adjusting for inflation, suggesting relatively stable operations rather than rapid expansion.

## 3. LEADERSHIP & POLITICS

### 3.1 Presidents (Honorary/Symbolic Leadership)

| Name | Tenure | Background |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Yitzhak-Hans Klinghoefer | 1976-1982 | German-born Israeli jurist |
| Haim Cohen | 1982-1988 | Supreme Court Justice |
| Shimon Agranat | 1988-1992 | Former Chief Justice of Supreme Court |
| Ruth Gavison | 1996-1999 | Hebrew University law professor, later known for Gavison-Medan Covenant |
| Sami Michael | 2001-2023 | Novelist, Iraqi-born Israeli author; served 22 years |
| Dan Yakir | 2023-Feb 2025 | ACRI's chief legal counsel for 28 years (1995-2023) |

**Note on Ruth Gavison:** Gavison was an ACRI founding-era figure (involved since 1974, chaired the board multiple times: 1975-77, 1982-84, 1986-87, 1992-94). She later moved rightward on some issues and proposed the Gavison-Medan Covenant balancing Jewish and democratic character. Her departure from the ACRI mainstream reflects the organization's ideological trajectory.

### 3.2 Executive Directors

| Name | Tenure | Background | Post-ACRI |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Amos Gil | Until 1999 | Unknown | Unknown |
| Ward Libna | 1999-2003 | Unknown | Unknown |
| Rachel Benziman | 2003-2008 | Unknown | Unknown |
| Hagai El-Ad (חגי אלעד) | 2008-2014 | Led ACRI for 6 years | **Became Executive Director of B'Tselem (2014-2023)** -- addressed UN Security Council on settlements |
| Sharon Abraham-Weiss (שרון אברהם-ויס) | 2014-2021 | Lawyer | Unknown |
| **Noa Sattath (נועה סתת)** | **Nov 2021-present** | Reform rabbi, LGBTQ activist, tech industry veteran | Current |

### 3.3 Noa Sattath -- Detailed Profile

**Born:** May 15, 1977, Jerusalem
**Education:**
- BA in History, Hebrew University of Jerusalem
- Ordained as Reform rabbi, Hebrew Union College (Jerusalem), 2014

**Military service:** IDF Military Intelligence, 1995-1997

**Career trajectory:**
1. Israeli software industry (pre-NGO career)
2. Executive Director, MEET (Israeli-Palestinian tech youth organization)
3. Executive Director, Jerusalem Open House (LGBTQ community center)
4. Executive Director, Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC) -- the public/legal arm of the Reform Movement in Israel, 2012-2021 (11 years)
5. Executive Director, ACRI, November 2021-present

**Political affiliation:** Placed in **83rd position on Meretz party Knesset list** for the April 2019 elections (21st Knesset). This was a symbolic position (no realistic chance of entering Knesset), but it formally establishes her partisan political affiliation.

**Personal:** Grew up secular, became religiously observant, came out as LGBTQ, became Reform rabbi. Did not circumcise her son (per Haaretz interview, Sept 2022).

**Key connections:**
- Reform Movement in Israel (IMPJ) -- deep institutional ties through IRAC
- LGBTQ movement -- former head of Jerusalem Open House
- Meretz party -- formal candidate
- NIF ecosystem -- IRAC is a major NIF grantee

**Analysis:** Sattath represents a specific ideological profile: Reform Judaism, LGBTQ activism, Meretz politics, and the NIF-funded NGO world. Her appointment marks a shift from ACRI's traditional legal-establishment leadership (lawyers, professors) to movement-oriented activist leadership. The fact that ACRI's CEO was a formal Meretz candidate undermines the organization's stated nonpartisan character.

### 3.4 Board Members (Partial -- Current/Recent)

| Name | Background | Joined |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Prof. Barak Medina | Rector, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; law professor; human rights law chair | Oct 2017 |
| Dr. Ra'anan Har-Zahav | Partner at law firm; expertise in immigration, refugee law, LGBT rights | Oct 2019 |
| Prof. Amit Schejter | Professor of Communication Studies, Ben-Gurion University; President of Oranim College | Unknown |
| Rachel Liel | Board Chair (2017-present) | 2017 |

**Previous notable board chairs:** Ari Shavit (journalist, later disgraced), Yuli Tamir (Labor politician, former Education Minister), Ruth Gavison, Edna Ullman-Margalit, Dori Spivak, Gila Stopler

**Note on Yuli Tamir:** She served as Israel's Minister of Education (2006-2009) while previously having chaired ACRI's board. This is a significant revolving-door connection.

### 3.5 Chief Legal Counsel

**Dan Yakir** served as ACRI's chief legal counsel from 1995 to 2023 -- nearly three decades. He joined ACRI's legal department in 1989. Yakir personally argued many of ACRI's landmark Supreme Court cases. He transitioned to the ceremonial President role in 2023.

### 3.6 Notable Alumni Pipeline

- **Hagai El-Ad:** ACRI Executive Director (2008-2014) --> B'Tselem Executive Director (2014-2023). This is the most significant alumni pipeline: the head of Israel's largest civil rights org moved directly to lead Israel's most prominent anti-occupation organization.
- **Hedva Radovanitz:** Headed ACRI's Tel Aviv office --> NIF Associate Director in Israel. In a 2010 WikiLeaks cable, told US embassy officials she "believed that in 100 years Israel would be majority Arab and that the disappearance of a Jewish state would not be the tragedy that Israelis fear since it would become more democratic."

## 4. IDEOLOGY & PROGRAMS

### 4.1 Stated Mission

"To act for the protection of human and civil rights in Israel and in territories under Israeli control and anywhere that the violation of rights is perpetrated by Israeli authorities or on their behalf."

### 4.2 Core Areas of Work

1. Freedom of expression and protest
2. Right to privacy
3. Freedom of/from religion
4. Women's rights
5. Criminal justice and prisoner rights
6. Arab minority rights
7. LGBTQ rights
8. Socioeconomic rights
9. Rights of migrants and refugees
10. Occupied Palestinian Territories
11. Democratic institutions and rule of law

### 4.3 Education Programs ("HaSadna" -- The Workshop)

**Website:** edu.acri.org.il / education.acri.org.il

**Programs offered:**
- Teacher training courses (recognized by Ministry of Education for professional development credits)
- Academic courses and workshops for student teachers
- Training for academic/administrative staff at universities and teacher training colleges
- Workshops in pre-military preparatory programs (mechinas)
- Consultation to school education teams, municipalities, academic institutions
- IHL (International Humanitarian Law) workshops for social activists, students, educators, youth movement counselors

**Curricula and Materials:**
- Lesson plans organized by rights categories (Hebrew and Arabic)
- Educational kits and resources
- Textbook: *"A Life Lesson: Anti-Racism Education from Kindergarten to High School"* (שיעור לחיים: חינוך נגד גזענות מגן ועד תיכון)
- Human rights calendar events
- Current events discussion guides for classrooms

**Topics covered:**
- Anti-racism education (K-12)
- Gender discrimination
- Ethnic/cultural background discrimination
- Skin color prejudice
- Religious discrimination
- Physical/mental health discrimination
- Democracy and civic participation
- International humanitarian law

**Analytical note:** The education programs present human rights as universal values but embed specific political positions within the framework. Teaching IHL in pre-military academies, for instance, shapes how future soldiers conceptualize the conflict. The anti-racism curriculum links "various forms of discrimination and inequality stemming from different backgrounds" -- which in the Israeli context means framing Jewish-Arab relations through a discrimination/racism lens rather than a national conflict lens. This is a methodological choice with political implications.

### 4.4 Annual "State of Human Rights" Report

Published annually on International Human Rights Day (December 10), these reports assess rights conditions across all ACRI's focus areas. The 2012 report claimed Israel faces a "bleak situation in nearly every category of rights." These reports function as an annual media event generating extensive coverage.

### 4.5 Ideological Evolution and Semantic Analysis

**Original positioning (1972-2000s):** Modeled on the ACLU. Universal civil liberties focus. Defended speech rights across the political spectrum (including right-wing activists). Founded to address post-1967 rights issues but maintained a broadly liberal, nonpartisan stance.

**Current positioning (2020s):** Has shifted significantly:

1. **Apartheid framework adoption:** In June 2023, ACRI co-published a report with 16 Israeli NGOs affirming that Israeli actions "meet the criteria of apartheid." In December 2022, signed a statement claiming "occupation and apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territories have made Jewish supremacy the de facto law of the land."

2. **"Judicial coup" framing:** Noa Sattath described the 2025 NGO tax bill as "part of the ongoing judicial coup" and a "systematic attack on all institutions that check government power."

3. **International advocacy intensification:** ACRI explicitly "views international advocacy as an essential channel" -- submitting shadow reports to UN bodies, meeting foreign diplomats, generating international media coverage. This is a deliberate strategy of external pressure.

**Hebrew vs. English messaging comparison:**

Both Hebrew and English websites are JavaScript-rendered (Wix platform), making direct content comparison difficult via automated tools. However, based on search results:

- The **English site** emphasizes "Occupied Palestinian Territories" framing, apartheid language, and positions ACRI within the international human rights ecosystem
- The **Hebrew site** appears to focus more on domestic civil liberties: labor rights, education rights, democratic institutions, privacy, protest rights
- The Hebrew education site (education.acri.org.il) focuses on anti-racism and democracy education
- There is likely some **semantic displacement** in how "democracy" is defined: ACRI's usage appears to center individual rights and minority protections as the essence of democracy, with less emphasis on majoritarian self-governance or Jewish democratic character

**Rabin's critique (1992):** PM Yitzhak Rabin himself dubbed ACRI the "Association for Hamas Rights" after ACRI defended detainees' legal rights during the First Intifada. This early tension between security establishment and civil liberties advocacy established a pattern that continues today.

### 4.6 Cross-Partisan History (Declining)

ACRI historically defended rights across the spectrum:
- Represented Yigal Amir's marriage case (right-wing criticism came from the left for this)
- Defended right-wing activists' speech rights
- Opposed a Nazi symbols ban in the Knesset (2014) on free speech grounds

This cross-partisan track record has eroded. The adoption of "apartheid" framing, joint statements with Palestinian NGOs, and the CEO's Meretz affiliation make the nonpartisan claim increasingly strained.

---

## 5. GOVERNMENT TIES & INFLUENCE

### 5.1 High Court of Justice (Bagatz) Petitions

ACRI is described as arguing "dozens of precedent-setting cases before the Supreme Court annually." This is its primary influence mechanism.

**Landmark victories (selected):**

| Case/Topic | Year | Outcome |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Press censorship regulations | Multiple | Struck down; led to 2017 repeal |
| Aili Miller (women in IDF) | 1995 | Opened military roles to women |
| Qa'adan (Arab land allocation) | 2000 | Prohibited discrimination in land allocation |
| Shin Bet torture methods | 1999 | Prohibited shaking and other interrogation techniques |
| Kafala (migrant labor bonds) | 2006 | Eliminated bonded labor system |

## 6. LEGAL ACTIONS & CONTROVERSIES

### 6.1 Im Tirtzu Campaign

Im Tirtzu has targeted ACRI as part of its broader campaign against left-wing NGOs:

- **"Goldstone enablers" campaign:** Im Tirtzu claimed 92% of Israeli sources in the Goldstone Report came from NIF-funded organizations including ACRI. ACRI responded that the UN committee approached them, not vice versa, and that the cited materials were public letters to the Attorney General.

- **"Sabotaging from within" report:** NGO Monitor-adjacent reports listed ACRI among organizations allegedly undermining Israel. Im Tirtzu specifically accused ACRI of defending terrorists' rights and working to provide academic programs to imprisoned terrorists.

- **National service positions bill:** In 2016, MK Amir Ohana introduced legislation (in cooperation with Im Tirtzu) to cancel national service positions in organizations receiving majority foreign government funding -- targeting organizations like ACRI.

### 6.2 NGO Transparency Law (2016)

The Knesset passed a law requiring NGOs receiving 50%+ of funding from foreign governments to disclose this in publications. ACRI opposed the law. Steven Beck (ACRI's international relations director) called it a "redundancy bill" since ACRI already disclosed its funding publicly. Of the 27 organizations affected, 25 were human rights NGOs -- the law was widely viewed as selectively targeting left-wing civil society.

### 6.3 NGO Tax Bill (2025-2026)

The current major threat to ACRI's operations:

- **February 2025:** Ministerial committee approved bill sponsored by Likud MK Ariel Kallner
- **Provisions:** 80% tax on foreign government donations; courts need not consider petitions from organizations "primarily financed by a foreign political entity"; Finance Minister can exempt individual NGOs; organizations receiving Israeli government funding automatically exempt
- **ACRI's response:** Noa Sattath called it "a direct assault on Israel's democracy" and part of the "ongoing judicial coup"
- **Status:** Advanced to Knesset committee hearings (May 2025)

**Analysis:** If passed, this bill would be existential for ACRI. With ~22% of income from foreign governments and virtually zero Israeli government funding, ACRI would face a massive tax burden and potentially lose standing to file court petitions -- its primary influence mechanism.

### 6.4 WikiLeaks / Radovanitz Controversy

In a February 2010 US embassy cable published by WikiLeaks, **Hedva Radovanitz** -- identified as a former ACRI Tel Aviv office head who moved to become NIF's Associate Director in Israel -- told US officials she "believed that in 100 years Israel would be majority Arab and that the disappearance of a Jewish state would not be the tragedy that Israelis fear since it would become more democratic." NIF stated this was her personal view. However, the fact that a senior ACRI/NIF figure held this view was cited extensively by critics.

### 6.5 Apartheid Report Controversy (2023)

ACRI's co-publication of a joint report with 16 Israeli NGOs asserting that Israeli actions meet "apartheid" criteria marked a significant escalation. For Israel's oldest civil rights organization to adopt this framework -- which much of the Israeli mainstream considers delegitimizing -- represented a crossing of a rhetorical Rubicon. The December 2022 statement claiming "Jewish supremacy" as "the de facto law of the land" further intensified criticism.

### 6.6 Defense of PFLP-Affiliated Organizations

In September 2019, ACRI signed a statement condemning the IDF raid on Addameer's office. Addameer is a Palestinian prisoner rights organization affiliated with the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine), which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US, EU, Canada, and Israel. In October 2021, ACRI signed a joint statement against the designation of six Palestinian organizations as terrorist entities, calling it a "draconian measure."

### 6.7 Criticism from the Left

- Considered too "establishment" and insufficiently protective of Palestinian rights
- Criticized for representing right-wing activists (including Yigal Amir's marriage case)
- Accused of prioritizing classical civil liberties over socioeconomic justice

### 6.8 Awards and Recognition

- **2011 Gruber Justice Prize** -- $500,000 from the Peter and Patricia Gruber Foundation (Yale) for "promoting and defending the rights of vulnerable communities"
- **2012 IIE Goldberg Prize** -- awarded alongside Adalah

### 6.9 No State Comptroller Findings

No State Comptroller audit findings specifically targeting ACRI were found in the research. This is notable -- the organization appears to maintain clean governance by regulatory standards.

## VALUES ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

Assessed against common Israeli civic values:

| Value | ACRI Alignment | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Rule of law | STRONG | Primary litigation organization for constitutional rights |
| Individual rights | STRONG | Core mission across 50+ years |
| Judicial independence | STRONG | Actively defends Supreme Court authority |
| Democratic institutions | STRONG (narrow definition) | Focuses on liberal-constitutional democracy; less emphasis on majoritarian aspects |
| Jewish-democratic balance | WEAK | Increasingly de-emphasizes Jewish character; no engagement with Jewish national rights as positive value |
| National security considerations | WEAK | Consistently prioritizes rights over security; opposes surveillance, interrogation techniques, military operations |
| Government transparency | STRONG | Advocates transparency; publishes its own financial data |
| Financial transparency (own) | MODERATE-STRONG | Reports to Registrar; data available; but donor relationships complex |
| Nonpartisan character | DECLINING | CEO was Meretz candidate; board includes political figures; ideological drift leftward |
| Pluralism | STRONG (within progressive spectrum) | Works across Jewish-Arab divide but increasingly aligned with progressive-left worldview |
| Israel's legitimacy | COMPLICATED | Defends Israeli democratic institutions but uses "apartheid" framework that critics say delegitimizes the state |

---

## KEY OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. **US Entity:** Does ACRI have any formal or informal US fundraising entity beyond the IAC? What is the legal structure of US donations flowing through NIF to ACRI?

2. **NIF Dependency:** What would happen to ACRI if NIF funding were cut? At ~25-30% of budget, this is a critical dependency.

3. **Education Content Analysis:** A detailed review of ACRI's actual curricula (the textbook "A Life Lesson" and lesson plan archives) would reveal whether the education programs present balanced democratic education or embed specific political positions.

4. **Board Composition:** The full current board list was not accessible due to JavaScript rendering. A complete board mapping with cross-board memberships would reveal network connections.

5. **Hebrew vs. English Messaging:** A systematic comparison of what ACRI says in Hebrew to Israeli audiences versus what it says in English to international/donor audiences would be revealing. The "apartheid" language appears more prominent in English-facing materials.

6. **Staff Political Affiliations:** Beyond Sattath's Meretz candidacy, what are the political affiliations of other senior staff? The ACRI-B'Tselem pipeline (El-Ad) and ACRI-NIF pipeline (Radovanitz) suggest a coherent ideological ecosystem.

7. **Impact of NGO Tax Bill:** How is ACRI preparing for the potential 80% tax on foreign government donations? Are they restructuring funding sources?
