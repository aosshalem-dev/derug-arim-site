## Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel

**Research Date:** 2026-02-16
**Gefen Program:** #18489 "מנהיגות חינוכית רב תרבותית" (Multicultural Educational Leadership)
**Gefen Rating:** 2/5 | 2 cities (Haifa, Jerusalem) | 5 schools | 107,860 NIS

## EXECUTIVE THESIS

Hand in Hand is Israel's most prominent and best-funded Jewish-Arab coexistence education project. With ~45M NIS annual turnover, 270 employees, 2,000+ students, and a US fundraising arm pulling in $9M/year, it is a major operation far exceeding its modest Gefen footprint (107,860 NIS for one program). The organization operates a dual-narrative, bilingual educational model that explicitly teaches both the Israeli and Palestinian narratives of the conflict side by side -- including joint commemoration of the Nakba alongside Israeli Independence Day. This positions it firmly in the "shared society" camp of Israeli civil society, drawing massive international philanthropic support (USAID, EU-adjacent foundations, US Jewish liberal philanthropy) while facing persistent attacks from the Israeli right (including literal arson from Lehava-affiliated extremists in 2014) and structural challenges around Jewish enrollment retention. The organization's Gefen presence is a tiny fraction of its actual operation -- a single Ministry of Education program worth ~108K NIS vs. total organizational revenue of 45M NIS.

## 2. FINANCES

### Israeli Entity (Amuta 580293710)

| Year | Annual Turnover (NIS) | Employees | Government Funding |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2024 | 45,095,891 | 270 | None documented |
| 2023 | 43,013,570 | ~270 | None documented |

- **Median for education sector:** 4,911,491 NIS -- Hand in Hand operates at ~9x the sector median
- **Government funding:** obudget.org explicitly states: "No government funding sources were documented for this organization over the past three years"
- **Ministry of Education recognition:** Schools ARE recognized, official, and supervised by the Ministry of Education; they receive per-student funding like any public school. But the *amuta itself* does not show direct government transfers in obudget records

**Key insight:** The schools receive Ministry of Education per-pupil funding as recognized public institutions, but the additional costs of the bilingual model (double teaching staff, multicultural programming, community work) are funded entirely through philanthropy and parent fees. Government funding flows to the schools as institutions, not to the amuta as an operator.

### US Entity (EIN 93-1269590) -- ProPublica 990 Data

| Year | Revenue (USD) | Expenses (USD) | Net Income | Grants Paid |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 2024 | $9,038,259 | $7,953,161 | $1,085,098 | $7,027,800 |
| 2023 | $10,877,661 | $7,102,544 | $3,775,117 | $6,520,000 |
| 2022 | $6,846,787 | $6,404,160 | $442,627 | — |
| 2021 | $5,718,164 | $6,044,830 | -$326,666 | — |
| 2020 | $5,365,703 | $6,396,746 | -$1,031,043 | — |
| 2019 | $6,781,647 | $4,901,184 | $1,880,463 | — |

**US Entity Assets (2024):** $7,972,655 total / $13,741 liabilities / $7,958,914 net assets

**Revenue Sources (2024):** 98.5% contributions ($8.9M) + 1.5% investment income ($133K)

**Key insight:** The US fundraising arm alone sends $7M+ per year to Israel. This is the primary funding pipeline. Combined with Israeli domestic revenue, the total operation exceeds 50M NIS equivalent.

### Compensation (US Entity, 2024)

| Name | Title | Compensation |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Lee Gordon | Co-Founder, Executive Director | $100,833 |
| Patricia Smith | Corporate Secretary/Office Manager | $58,333 |
| Board members | 14 independent directors | $0 |

Executive compensation represents 4.8% of total expenses -- extremely lean by nonprofit standards.

## 5. IDEOLOGY & CURRICULUM

### Core Philosophy
Hand in Hand describes its mission as "promoting and developing a shared society for Arabs and Jews in Israel" (Hebrew site) and "building inclusion and equality between Arab and Jewish citizens" (English site).

### What They Teach About the Conflict

**Dual-Narrative Approach:**
- Students learn the SAME historical events from BOTH perspectives
- The curriculum explicitly acknowledges that "what represents happiness for [Jewish children] is someone else's sadness" (re: Independence Day/Nakba)
- Dual-narrative history is taught: "learning about conflicts not just from one point of view, but from multiple ones -- to see how the same events can be shaped into different stories"

**Memorial Day / Independence Day / Nakba Handling:**
- **Separate ceremonies** for Jewish and Arab students on Memorial Day (~30 minutes each)
- Jewish students commemorate fallen Israeli soldiers and Israel's founding
- Arab students discuss the Nakba -- displacement of Palestinians in 1948
- Both groups wear white (Israeli school tradition)
- After separation, students **reunite** for a concluding event designed to "transition from pain to hope"
- Some schools release balloons as symbols of shared hope
- The school explicitly names and acknowledges the Nakba

**Key quote (Shuli Dichter, former CEO):** The structure provides "room for each one to be with their own pain and not be in a position of comparing how much space is being made to each side."

### Hebrew vs English Messaging Comparison

| Element | Hebrew Site (hih.org.il) | English Site (handinhandk12.org) |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Mission | "לקדם ולפתח חברה משותפת לערבים ויהודים בישראל" | "Building inclusion and equality between Arab and Jewish citizens" |
| Identity framing | "יהודים וערבים" (Jews and Arabs) | "Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel" |
| Political positioning | Emphasis on "shared citizenship" (אזרחות משותפת) | Emphasis on "equality and mutual respect" |
| Conflict language | More restrained; focuses on "shared living" | More explicit about "multiple viewpoints" and "complicated issues" |

**Analysis:** The messaging is broadly consistent, but the English site leans more into diversity/inclusion framing familiar to American donors, while the Hebrew site emphasizes civic partnership ("חברה משותפת" -- shared society). Neither site uses explicitly "post-Zionist" language. The framing is closer to "civic equality within the existing state" than to anti-Zionist ideology. However, the explicit acknowledgment of the Nakba and dual-narrative approach places them firmly outside Zionist-consensus education.

### Is It Post-Zionist?

**Short answer:** It is not explicitly post-Zionist, but it is certainly non-Zionist in educational practice.

- The schools operate within the Ministry of Education framework (recognized and supervised)
- They do not reject the State of Israel or advocate for a binational state
- However, they do treat Jewish and Arab/Palestinian narratives as equally valid
- The dual-narrative approach implicitly rejects Zionist historiography as the sole legitimate framework
- The 60/40 Arab-Jewish demographic split and the explicit Nakba commemoration place them well outside mainstream Israeli educational norms

A 2011 Israeli law allows the finance minister to defund schools teaching the Nakba as a day of mourning -- this law was directly relevant to Hand in Hand's practice.

### Key Funding Observations

1. **USAID was a core funder** -- listed as a "Visionary" (top tier). USAID's closure in 2025 likely created a significant funding gap
2. **New Israel Fund connection:** NIF Australia specifically fundraises for Hand in Hand (https://www.nif.org.au/handinhand). NIF is a known funder
3. **European funding:** German Catholic mission (Sternsinger), UK foundations (Rayne Trust, Pears Foundation), Swiss DEAR Foundation. No direct EU government funding documented
4. **US Jewish liberal establishment:** UJA-Federation of New York, Schusterman, multiple liberal Jewish family foundations
5. **No Abraham Fund listed** as a direct donor (they are a separate shared-society org, not a funder of HiH)
6. **$11M campus donation** for Jerusalem school from Jerusalem Foundation, Rayne Foundation, and European donors
7. **Government funding is ~0% of amuta revenue** -- entirely philanthropy-funded beyond per-pupil Ministry allocations

## 7. CONTROVERSIES

### A. The 2014 Arson Attack (most serious incident)

**Date:** November 29, 2014
**Target:** Max Rayne Hand in Hand School, Jerusalem (first-grade classroom)
**What happened:** Three Jewish extremists torched a classroom and spray-painted racist graffiti including:
- "There is no coexistence with cancer"
- "Death to the Arabs" (מוות לערבים)
- "Kahane was right"

**Perpetrators:**
- Yitzhak Gabai
- Nahman Twitto
- Shlomo Twitto
- All linked to **Lehava** (anti-miscegenation organization)

**Sentencing:** Twitto brothers convicted via plea deal; sentenced to 2 and 2.5 years respectively; ordered to pay NIS 25,000 combined compensation.

**Controversy within the controversy:** Defendants were NOT charged with nationalistic/racist crimes (which could carry terrorism-level penalties in Israeli law). Mother of one arsonist publicly said she "would have done the same."

**Political fallout:** AJC, Israeli politicians, and international community condemned the attack. Jerusalem municipality later sued arsonists for damages. Police raided Lehava offices. The attack became a symbol of anti-coexistence extremism.

- https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4597550,00.html

### B. Jewish Student Enrollment Decline (Wadi Ara)

A major 2011 Ynet investigation titled "גשר צר מאוד: ביה"ס הדו-לשוני התרוקן מיהודים" (A Very Narrow Bridge: The Bilingual School Emptied of Jews) documented:
- **Bridge Over the Wadi school (Kafr Qara):** Started with balanced enrollment
- By ~2011: Only 23 Jewish students vs. 105 Arab students (~82% Arab)
- **Reasons cited:** Security concerns in Arab sector, political tensions, commute distance
- Parents' committee chair Hussam Abu-Bakr: "We face a real crisis... some classes have only Arab students, others just two or three Jewish students"
- Education Ministry confirmed the trend exists "across all bilingual schools"
- Dissenting view (Norit Maor-Shavit): Blame administrative instability, not politics

**This is a structural vulnerability** of the model. Arab families have high demand (waiting lists), while Jewish families face social pressure not to send children to "Arab" schools, especially in peripheral areas.

**Source:** https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4026730,00.html

### C. Criticism from the Right

- Lehava and affiliated groups see coexistence education as promoting "assimilation" between Jews and Arabs
- Spray-painting, harassment of students on buses documented
- No formal NGO Monitor report targeting Hand in Hand was found -- unusual for an organization of this profile. NGO Monitor may view it as educational rather than political-advocacy
- Im Tirtzu has not publicly targeted Hand in Hand in the way it has targeted ACRI or NIF-funded advocacy groups
- The 2011 Nakba Law (allowing defunding of schools marking the Nakba as mourning) was directly relevant to Hand in Hand's dual-narrative ceremonies

### D. Criticism from the Left / Academic Critique

- Haaretz op-ed (Mira Sucharov, 2016): "Are Israel's Jewish-Arab Coexistence Schools Setting Kids Up for a Cruel Fall?" -- argues graduates face a "very dissonant outside world" where coexistence skills have no real application in segregated Israeli society
- The question of whether dual-narrative education creates false hope in a structurally unequal society is a persistent academic concern
- Some Palestinian activists view participation in Israeli institutions (even bilingual ones) as normalization

### E. October 7 War Impact

- Families at Hand in Hand lost relatives both in Gaza and to the October 7 attacks
- Palestinian students faced societal harassment outside school; Hand in Hand became a "rare oasis of freedom"
- Vice Principal Engie Wattad: "For our students, this is a safe place... They feel here that they have freedom of speech"
- Palestinian parent Morad Muna called it "the one safe place right now for their kids"
- Despite enormous pressure, all six schools completed a full year of learning in 2024-25

## 9. IMPACT & ALUMNI

### Quantified Outcomes
- **700+ graduates** have completed Hand in Hand schools
- **2,000+ current students** (ages 3-18)
- **3,000+ active adult community members**
- **10,000+ indirect impact** through community programming

### Alumni Program
- Supports graduates in being "civically active, advancing social change"
- Alumni serve as "ambassadors for shared living" in universities, service institutions, and workplaces
- No published data on specific career outcomes, military service choices, or political positions

### Policy Impact
- Municipal officials influenced to create bilingual government forms
- Arabic translations added at local businesses in Hand in Hand communities
- Tel Aviv-Jaffa education official: "You have changed Jaffa. There has never been such a massive demand"
- Bilingual children's programming expanded to libraries and daycare centers beyond Hand in Hand

### Academic Note
No published longitudinal outcome study tracking Hand in Hand graduates' political positions, inter-group attitudes in adulthood, or career trajectories was found. This is a significant research gap for a 25+ year old educational experiment.

## 10. MIDOT EFFECTIVENESS SEAL

Hand in Hand holds a **Midot Seal of Effectiveness** (תו מידות לאפקטיביות) from Midot -- Israel's leading nonprofit evaluator. The Midot page (https://www.midot.org.il/יד-ביד-המרכז-לחינוך-יהודי-ערבי-בישראל) returned 404 at time of research, so detailed scores could not be retrieved.

---

## 11. VALUES ALIGNMENT TABLE

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Transparency** | 4/5 | GuideStar Israel profile complete; US entity 98% Charity Navigator; donors page public; financial reports available. Minor gap: no detailed Israeli financial breakdown |
| **Ideological openness** | 2/5 | Explicitly dual-narrative; acknowledges Nakba; treats Palestinian narrative as equal to Israeli. This is either a 5/5 or 1/5 depending on political perspective |
| **Government independence** | 5/5 | No government funding to amuta beyond standard per-pupil school allocations. Entirely philanthropy-driven |
| **Foreign funding dependency** | 1/5 (high dependency) | US arm sends $7M+/year; total foreign philanthropy likely accounts for 50%+ of all revenue |
| **Domestic rootedness** | 4/5 | 270 employees, 2,000 students, 6 campuses, community programs. Real operations on the ground |
| **Academic rigor** | 3/5 | Ministry-recognized schools with strong test results and awards. However, no published longitudinal alumni study |
| **Demographic sustainability** | 2/5 | 60/40 Arab-Jewish split; Jewish enrollment flight documented; structural vulnerability in attracting/retaining Jewish families |

---

## 12. GEFEN CONTEXT

The Gefen catalog lists Hand in Hand under program #18489 "מנהיגות חינוכית רב תרבותית" (Multicultural Educational Leadership) at 107,860 NIS across 2 cities (Haifa, Jerusalem), 5 schools, rated 2/5.

**This is a tiny window into a massive organization.** The 108K NIS Gefen program is likely one small Ministry-funded training initiative, while the actual organizational budget is 45M NIS (420x larger). The Gefen rating of 2/5 for this specific program should not be confused with the organization's overall quality -- which has won national and international awards including the Global Pluralism Award and Ministry of Education recognition for multiple schools.

---

## 13. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. **What is the exact government funding flow?** obudget shows zero direct transfers, but schools ARE Ministry-recognized. How much per-pupil funding flows through municipalities vs. directly?
2. **USAID closure impact:** USAID was a top-tier "Visionary" donor. What was the annual amount, and how has its 2025 closure affected operations?
3. **NIF funding quantum:** NIF Australia fundraises for HiH; what is the total NIF contribution across all country offices?
4. **EU funding:** No direct EU government grants found, but German Sternsinger/Catholic mission and Swiss DEAR Foundation are EU-adjacent. Any direct Brussels grants?
5. **Alumni tracking:** With 700+ graduates, why is there no published longitudinal study? What do graduates actually do?
6. **Jewish enrollment trends post-Oct 7:** Has the 60/40 ratio shifted? Has demand from either community changed?
7. **Gefen program specifics:** What exactly is the "מנהיגות חינוכית רב תרבותית" program, and why is it rated 2/5?
8. **Shahaf Gal's Movement for Quality Government tenure:** What was his role there, and does this indicate a political network?
