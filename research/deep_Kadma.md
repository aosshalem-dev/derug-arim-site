## 1. History & Founding

### Origins (1993-1994)
The **Kedma Association** (עמותת קדמה) was founded in **1993**, emerging from activity within the **HeLaH organization** (הל"ה — הורים למען החינוך / Parents for Education). The first school, **Kedma Jerusalem**, opened its doors in **September 1994**.

### Founders
The founding group was a coalition of academics, educators, parents, and social activists from disadvantaged neighborhoods:
- **Clara Yona-Meshumar (קלרה יונה-משומר)** — The primary founder and first principal. She grew up in the Katamon neighborhood herself, daughter of a Libyan-born father (police officer) and Yemenite-born mother (cleaning worker). Despite her modest background, she earned two degrees from the Hebrew University. Before founding Kedma, she managed the Hebrew University's preparatory program.
- **Dr. Shlomo Swirski (שלמה סבירסקי)** — Sociologist, social activist, founder and academic director of the Adva Center (a research institute on social equality in Israel). Winner of the 2005 Naphtali Prize for Social and Economic Sciences.
- **Sami Shalom Shitrit (סמי שלום שטרית)** — Poet and Mizrachi activist. He proposed the name "קדמה" (Kedma), which carries a double meaning: "progress/forward" and "eastward" (toward the Mizrach/East). He also served as founding principal of the Kedma branch in Tel Aviv's Hatikva neighborhood.
- **Prof. Meir Buzaglo (מאיר בוזגלו)** — Philosopher, Hebrew University.
- **Prof. Henriette Dahan-Kalev (הנרייט דהאן כלב)** — Political scientist, Ben-Gurion University. Founder of the Gender Studies program there. Also served on B'Tselem's board.
- **Eli Sha'aya (אלי שעיה)** — Social activist.

### The Name
The name "קדמה" (Kedma) was deliberately chosen by Sami Shalom Shitrit to embody both "progress" and an "eastward" orientation — a direct assertion of Mizrachi cultural identity and a reclaiming of the East/Orient as a source of pride rather than stigma.

### Political Support at Founding
- **Amnon Rubinstein** — Then-Education Minister (Meretz party), supported and approved the establishment of the Kedma network.
- **Benny Begin** — Likud MK, also provided early support.

### Turbulent Early Years
Kedma's founding year (1994) was marked by extreme instability:
1. The school opened with **two 7th-grade classes and 50 students**.
2. First location: a former bank branch in **Gilo** — the Jerusalem municipality issued a **closure order** against it.
3. Second location: rooms in **Beit Shmuel** (Shimshon Center).
4. Third location: a **garage in the Talpiot industrial zone**, where students finished the first year.
5. Year two: relocated to an **abandoned trailer** (former community center) in Katamon.
6. **1997:** Moved to the **current permanent building** in the heart of the Katamon neighborhood — a two-story structure with six classrooms.
7. **2002:** Moved to the current address at **53 Bar Yochai Street** (later sources also cite Bar Yochai 3 or 5), sharing the former Patt Elementary School building with ORT Spanien Technological High School.

### The Broader Vision — and Its Partial Failure
The original ambition was to create a **national network of 15 Kedma schools** across Israel — an academic high school in every disadvantaged neighborhood. This vision was only partially realized:
- **Kedma Jerusalem (1994)** — the flagship, still operating today.
- **Kedma Tel Aviv (1994-1999)** — opened in the Hatikva neighborhood; faced a **boycott by neighborhood residents** who considered the school's ideology "too extreme" and far from mainstream national consensus. By 1997 only 4 students enrolled. **Closed in January 1999** after conflicts with the Tel Aviv municipality.
- **Kedma Kiryat Malachi (1995)** — closed within one year.
- **Neve Hof School, Rishon LeZion (from 2012)** — an existing elementary school transferred to Kedma's management. Clara Yona-Meshumar served as its principal from 2012 to 2022.

A 2014 **Haaretz investigative article** titled "Why Did the Mizrachi Education Enterprise Fail: Twenty Years of Kedma" documented the initiative as "a story of a missed opportunity" — noting that of 15 planned schools, only 3 opened, and only 1 (Jerusalem) survived the "ego battles, ideological disputes, media scandals, legal battles, and inevitable politics."

## 2. Current Structure

### Basic Facts
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full name** | בית ספר תיכון קדמה ירושלים (Kedma Jerusalem High School) |
| **Type** | Public secular (ממלכתי) secondary school |
| **Grades** | 7-12 (middle school + high school / חטיבת ביניים + חטיבה עליונה) |
| **Students** | ~136 (73 boys, 63 girls) — as of 2025 data |
| **Class size** | Capped at 25 students per class |
| **Teaching staff** | 25 teachers (7 male, 18 female); most hold M.A. degrees |
| **Address** | Bar Yochai Street, Katamonim (הקטמונים), Jerusalem |

### Location Context
The Katamonim neighborhood is historically one of Jerusalem's poorest areas, a transit camp (ma'abara) neighborhood populated primarily by Mizrachi Jewish immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s. The school was deliberately placed here as a community-based institution serving its own neighborhood.

## 3. Educational Philosophy

### Core Approach: Critical Pedagogy
Kedma is described as **"a distinct model of implementing the educational approach of critical pedagogy"** (פדגוגיה ביקורתית). This is not a democratic school in the formal sense (like Sudbury/Hadera democratic schools), but rather a school grounded in:

1. **Belief in universal capability**: The conviction that most children from disadvantaged neighborhoods can achieve full matriculation and university education given appropriate conditions.
2. **Anti-tracking**: No academic streaming/grouping. All students study in heterogeneous classes toward full academic matriculation (bagrut).
3. **Community-based education**: The school functions as a community institution, not just a classroom. Parents are full partners in the educational process.
4. **Cultural pride and identity**: Students' Mizrachi heritage is celebrated, not suppressed. The curriculum connects to students' traditions and culture.
5. **Social consciousness**: Development of critical thinking and social awareness alongside academic achievement.

### The Accompaniers/Mentors Model (מודל המלווים)
Kedma's signature pedagogical innovation is the **"Melavim" (Accompaniers) Model**:
- Each class has **two homeroom teachers** (called "melavim" / מלווים — "accompaniers").
- These teachers support students in **all dimensions**: academic, social, and emotional.
- The model creates an "educational triangle" of students, teachers, and parents, with students at the center.

### Learning Clusters (אשכולות למידה)
Learning is organized in **clusters that integrate multiple subject areas**:
- Classes last 1.5 hours (not the standard 45-minute period).
- Each cluster follows a three-stage self-learning model: (1) raising a question, (2) inquiry process, (3) review and summary together.
- Emphasis on depth, creativity, and connection to students' lived experience.

### Stated Values
- Open, direct dialogue
- Self-awareness and mutual understanding
- Respectful treatment
- Belief in success and possibility
- Creation of Israeli, democratic, pluralistic culture

## 4. Ideological Orientation

### Mizrachi Identity Politics
Kedma is explicitly and foundationally a **Mizrachi social justice project**. It was conceived as a **secular alternative to Shas's "El HaMa'ayan" educational network** — offering Mizrachi identity, cultural pride, and community empowerment without the ultra-Orthodox religious framework.

The founders were prominent Mizrachi intellectuals and activists who saw education as the key battleground for Mizrachi equality in Israeli society. The school's founding thesis is that the Israeli education system systematically fails Mizrachi students from disadvantaged neighborhoods — steering them toward vocational tracks instead of academic ones, and perpetuating cycles of poverty and social marginalization.

### Political Orientation
- **Left-leaning on social justice**: The founders include key figures of Israel's Mizrachi left — Shlomo Swirski (Adva Center), Henriette Dahan-Kalev (feminist scholar), Sami Shalom Shitrit (Democratic Mizrachi Rainbow / הקשת הדמוקרטית המזרחית).
- **Cross-party founding support**: Despite the left-leaning founders, the school received initial support from both Amnon Rubinstein (Meretz/center-left) and Benny Begin (Likud/right), suggesting that the educational mission transcended partisan lines.
- **Not a democratic school**: Despite democratic values in its stated mission, Kedma is not formally part of Israel's democratic education movement. It is a structured, academic, matriculation-oriented school.

### Connection to Social Movements
- **The Democratic Mizrachi Rainbow (הקשת הדמוקרטית המזרחית)**: Several founders were active in this movement.
- **Adva Center**: Shlomo Swirski's social policy research institute, which has documented educational inequality in Israel.
- **Broader Mizrachi activism**: The school emerged from the same intellectual milieu as Israel's Mizrachi identity politics of the 1990s — itself rooted in the Black Panthers movement of the 1970s.

## 5. Leadership

### Founding Principal
**Clara Yona-Meshumar (קלרה יונה-משומר)** — Led the school from its founding in 1994 until approximately 2006. Personal biography is itself a Kedma success story: grew up in Katamon, from a family of eight, parents were Libyan/Yemenite immigrants in manual labor jobs. She overcame the system's low expectations, earned two degrees from Hebrew University, and returned to build the school her neighborhood never had. After leaving Kedma Jerusalem, she went on to manage Neve Hof elementary school in Rishon LeZion (2012-2022).

### Current Principal
**Michal Hadad (מיכל חדד)** — Current school principal. She received the National Education Prize in 2015 on behalf of the school, at a ceremony at Yad Ben-Zvi attended by Education Minister Naftali Bennett.

### Organization Leadership
- **Ilana Yona** — Director of the Kedma Association (holds M.A. in Public Policy from Tel Aviv University). Listed as Education Director.
- **Dr. Shlomo Swirski** — Remains involved in an advisory/intellectual capacity.

### "Justice Worker" Prize Committee
Since 2007, Kedma awards the **"Oved Tzedek" (עובד צדק / Justice Worker) Prize** for education demonstrating social awareness. The committee has included Clara Yona-Shomer, Shlomo Swirski, Esther Herzog, and the late **Yossi Sarid** (former Education Minister and Meretz leader, d. 2015).

## 8. Achievements & Recognition

### Academic Outcomes
- **Matriculation rate**: 72-85% of graduates complete full bagrut (sources vary by year; the most recent data from the founder claims 80-85%). This is extraordinary given that when the school was founded, the neighborhood's matriculation rate was **near zero**.

- **Context**: Israel's national average for disadvantaged populations is ~40% full matriculation; affluent areas reach 65%+.

### Awards
- **2014**: Jerusalem Education Director Prize (Avi Saley Prize) — recognized for heterogeneity, dialogue, and community engagement. Ceremony attended by Mayor Nir Barkat.
- **2014**: Minchai Education Prize (פרס מנח"י).
- **2015**: **National Education Prize** (פרס החינוך הארצי) — Awarded by the Ministry of Education. Ceremony at Yad Ben-Zvi, attended by Education Minister Naftali Bennett.
- Ministry of Education selection as a **"Quality Pedagogy" school**.

### Academic Research
The school has been the subject of academic research:
- **Bar Shalom, Y. & Krumer Navo, M. (2007)** — "The Usage of Qualitative Methods as Means to Empower Disadvantaged Groups: The Example of the Kedma School in Jerusalem." *The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences*, 2(1), 237-244.
- The school's model is described as being "studied in every education school and faculty in the country."

## 9. Controversies & Challenges

### Early Resistance from Jerusalem Municipality
The Jerusalem municipal education system was not supportive of Kedma's establishment. In the school's first year, the municipality issued a **closure order** against its temporary location in Gilo, forcing the school to relocate multiple times.

### Tel Aviv Branch Boycott & Closure (1994-1999)
The most significant controversy in Kedma's history was the **Tel Aviv Hatikva branch**:
- Neighborhood residents **boycotted the school**, considering its Mizrachi-identity ideology "too extreme and far from the consensual national ideology."
- Enrollment collapsed: by 1997, only **4 students** had enrolled.
- Conflicts with the Tel Aviv municipality education department.
- The branch **closed in January 1999**.

### Kiryat Malachi Closure (1995-1996)
The Kiryat Malachi branch closed within its first year, reasons not extensively documented.

### The "Failed Enterprise" Narrative
A 2014 Haaretz article framed the broader Kedma project as a partial failure: of 15 planned schools, only 1 survived. The article documented "ego battles, ideological disputes, media scandals, legal battles, and inevitable politics" within the movement. This represents a self-critical narrative within Kedma's own milieu, acknowledging that the grand vision of a national Mizrachi education network was not realized.

### Ideological Tension
Kedma occupies an inherently contested space:
- Some in the Mizrachi community viewed it as too leftist/secular (preferring Shas's El HaMa'ayan religious network).
- Some in the educational establishment viewed it as too identity-political or too focused on Mizrachi particularism.
- The school navigates between being a social justice project and being a pragmatic academic institution focused on matriculation outcomes.

### No Major Recent Controversies
No significant public controversies were found in recent years. The school appears to have settled into a stable, recognized, and respected position within Jerusalem's educational landscape.

## 10. Network & Expansion

### Current Kedma Network
As of 2025-2026, the Kedma Association operates:
1. **Kedma Jerusalem** — The flagship school (grades 7-12, ~136 students).
2. **Neve Hof Elementary School, Rishon LeZion** — Under Kedma management since 2012; Clara Yona-Meshumar served as principal until 2022.

### Closed Branches
- Kedma Tel Aviv / Hatikva (1994-1999) — closed
- Kedma Kiryat Malachi (1995-1996) — closed

### Expansion Plans
The Matanel Foundation page references plans to "establish additional schools beyond Jerusalem in central Israel," and the original vision was for 15 schools. However, no concrete new school openings have been documented in recent years. The association appears to have shifted emphasis toward **disseminating its pedagogical model** through teacher training, publications, and conferences rather than directly operating new schools.

## 13. Analytical Assessment

### What Makes Kedma Distinctive
Kedma is not just a school — it is an **ideological project** that sought to prove a thesis: that Mizrachi students from Israel's poorest neighborhoods, systematically written off by the education system, could achieve academic excellence if given the right environment. The school's 72-85% matriculation rate (vs. near-zero when it was founded) validates this thesis at the Jerusalem site.

### Why the Network Didn't Scale
The Haaretz analysis points to internal conflicts, ideological disputes, and institutional resistance. The Tel Aviv boycott is particularly revealing: the very community Kedma aimed to serve rejected it, possibly because the explicit Mizrachi-identity framing felt politically loaded or because secular Mizrachi families preferred mainstream integration over identity-based education.

### Current Positioning
Today, Kedma Jerusalem functions as a small, respected, well-regarded school with strong outcomes — more "successful community school" than "revolutionary movement." The association's influence extends beyond its ~136 students through teacher training, publications, and its pedagogical model being studied in Israeli education faculties.

### Comparison to Shas's El HaMa'ayan
Where Shas offered Mizrachi identity through religion (ultra-Orthodox education network), Kedma offered Mizrachi identity through secular critical pedagogy. Shas's network grew vastly larger. Kedma's secular alternative remained small but intellectually influential.
