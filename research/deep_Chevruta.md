## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / THESIS

Chevruta - The Center for Jewish Awareness is a **Religious-Zionist mission-driven organization (garin torani)** operating since 2007 from central Tel Aviv, primarily through its cultural center "HaMakom" (The Place) at Beit Ohel Shem, Balfour 30. Despite its soft-sounding name ("Jewish Awareness"), this is a **settler-movement-affiliated outreach operation** founded by Rabbi Yair Kartman (linked to the far-right "Komemiyut" movement) and led by Rabbi Ariel Dorfman (a Gush Katif evacuee who teaches Rabbi Kook's writings). The organization has a board member named Akiva Smotrich -- brother of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.

The org operates at the intersection of Jewish-identity outreach to secular populations and Religious-Zionist settlement ideology, receiving over **9 million NIS annually** (2024) with substantial government funding from the Ministry of Education, the Settlement Division, and the Ministry of Settlement. A 2018 Yedioth Ahronoth investigation flagged the organization for receiving Settlement Division funds designated for disadvantaged populations while operating in affluent central Tel Aviv.

**The Gefen school programs (103,582 NIS across 8 cities and 20 schools) represent only a tiny fraction of its total activity** -- the core operation is the HaMakom cultural center and its 200+ weekly chevruta study participants.

### Staffing

| Year | Employees | Volunteers |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 2024 | 27 | 84 |

### Financial Red Flags (from Yedioth Ahronoth investigation, 2018)

- Received **720,000+ NIS from the Settlement Division** over two years, despite funds being designated for disadvantaged populations in peripheral areas -- Chevruta operates in central Tel Aviv.
- In 2015, reported to the Registry of Associations attempts to recover from a **"severe deficit"** and took out loans of **"extensive scope."**
- Rabbi Kartman personally loaned the organization **"tens of thousands of shekels"** from his private account.
- Rabbi Dorfman and his wife together received **"hundreds of thousands of shekels"** in salaries.
- Separate funding stream: 700,000 NIS/year from the Housing Ministry for operating HaMakom.

### Gefen System School Programs

From the original research data: 103,582 NIS across 8 cities, 20 schools. This represents **barely 1% of the organization's total revenue**, suggesting the school programs are a minor part of operations compared to the HaMakom center activities.

## 4. IDEOLOGY: "JEWISH AWARENESS" IN PRACTICE

### What "Jewish Awareness" Actually Means

Despite the neutral-sounding name, Chevruta's ideology is firmly **Religious-Zionist**, specifically within the school of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (Rav Kook). Key indicators:

1. **Torah kernel model (garin torani):** The organization is structured as a mission-driven community of Religious-Zionist families who settle in predominantly secular neighborhoods to spread Jewish observance and strengthen Jewish identity.

2. **Rav Kook's philosophy:** Dorfman explicitly teaches Kook's writings. In Kook's framework, secular Jews are unwitting carriers of holiness who need to be reconnected to their spiritual roots -- the secular-religious encounter is itself part of the messianic process of national redemption.

3. **"Return to Judaism" (hazara b'tshuva) framing:** The Rosh Yehudi connection is explicit -- Rosh Yehudi's founder Israel Zeira stated they want to be "Zionist Chabadniks" and are "proud of our religiousization" (hadatah). Dorfman is described as coming to Tel Aviv "to spread the Torah of Rav Kook."

4. **Settlement ideology:** Funding from the Settlement Division, board member from the Smotrich family, founder from Beit El, connection to Komemiyut movement -- all point to a Religious-Zionist settlement ideology that views settling in Tel Aviv as a form of "internal settlement."

5. **Post-October 7 shift:** Since the war, HaMakom explicitly pivoted from personal empowerment to **national identity** questions -- "what it means to be Jewish," "why we're here in Israel," "why Jews are persecuted." This aligns with Religious-Zionist framing of the conflict as existential-spiritual.

### NOT Progressive / NOT Pluralist / NOT Post-Zionist

The organization is the **opposite** of progressive Judaism, pluralism, or post-Zionism:
- It is Orthodox in religious orientation
- Its leaders are settlers or settlement-affiliated
- Its board includes a member of the Smotrich family
- It is connected to the far-right Komemiyut movement
- It teaches Rav Kook's religious-national philosophy
- Its funding comes heavily from settlement-oriented government ministries

The "awareness" in "Jewish Awareness" is closer to **kiruv** (religious outreach) within a Religious-Zionist frame than to liberal/pluralist Jewish identity exploration.

## 5. PROGRAMS

### HaMakom (The Place) - Core Activity

- **Location:** Beit Ohel Shem, Balfour 30, Tel Aviv (originally founded by poet Chaim Nachman Bialik)
- **Opened:** 2008
- **Activities:**
  - Weekly chevruta (paired study) sessions -- 200+ participants per week, pairing religious and secular Jews
  - Courses and workshops on Kabbalah, Talmud, psychology, Jewish philosophy
  - Cultural performances and events
  - Holiday programming (Shabbat, festivals)
  - Student scholarship program
  - Activities for schools, youth movements, and community partners
- **Instructors:** "Dozens" including educators, musicians, psychologists, and rabbis
- **Website:** https://makom.org.il/

### Gefen-Approved School Programs

Based on the original research data from the Gefen mapping:

| Program | Gefen ID | Theme | Scale |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| 0% Indifference (0% אדישות) | #13171 | Anti-racism (R1 agent-researched) | Part of 8-city, 20-school deployment |
| Direct Encounter (מפגש ישיר) | #31502 | Unknown specific content (R3 designation) | Part of 8-city, 20-school deployment |

**Note:** Detailed content of these specific programs could not be found through web searches. The program names suggest anti-racism and intercultural encounter themes, but given the organization's Religious-Zionist orientation, these likely frame "encounters" through a Jewish-identity lens rather than a progressive anti-racism framework. The total Gefen allocation of 103,582 NIS is a tiny fraction of the org's 9M+ annual revenue.

### Cities of Operation (from Gefen mapping)

Beer Sheva, Herzliya, Haifa, Jerusalem, Rosh HaAyin, Ramat Gan, Ra'anana, Tel Aviv

This geographic spread maps to known Torah kernel (garin torani) deployment patterns -- these are all cities where Religious-Zionist families establish mission-driven communities.

## 6. NETWORK CONNECTIONS

### Rosh Yehudi (ראש יהודי)

- **Founder:** Israel Zeira (ישראל זעירא)
- **Connection:** Dorfman is described as having come to Tel Aviv within the "Rosh Yehudi" kernel framework
- **Ideology:** Explicitly Religious-Zionist kiruv; Zeira stated "we want to be Zionist Chabadniks" and is "proud of our religiousization"
- **Controversies:** Zeira was found to be living illegally in a synagogue basement he converted to a residence; Tel Aviv municipality initiated legal proceedings in 2024
- **Note:** Rosh Yehudi is a separate organization but shares the same physical and ideological ecosystem

### MAKOM Council of Mission-Driven Communities (חיבור חדש)

- The Chevruta-HaMakom listing appears on the "Chibur Hadash" (New Connection) website, which is the council/umbrella organization for mission-driven communities (garinim) in Israel
- This confirms Chevruta's self-identification as a mission-driven settlement kernel

### Komemiyut (קוממיות)

- Rabbi Yair Kartman (co-founder) is a member of the management of "Komemiyut - Spirit and Strength for a Jewish Israel"
- The Yedioth investigation alleged Chevruta served as an **operational arm** for the Komemiyut caucus, facilitating legislative initiatives while obscuring ideological motivations
- Komemiyut is a far-right Religious-Zionist movement

### Smotrich Family Connection

- Board member Akiva Smotrich is the brother of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich
- This creates a direct connection to the most senior Religious-Zionist politician in Israel's government

---

## 7. GOVERNMENT TIES AND FUNDING MECHANISMS

### Ministry of Education (Largest Funder)

- **6.3M+ NIS cumulative** for "Jewish Culture" and "National Educational Nucleus" budget lines
- The Torah Institutions Department within MoE provides an additional 1.7M+ NIS
- Gefen system school programs are a small but visible part of MoE relationship

### Settlement Division / Ministry of Settlement

- **1.26M+ NIS cumulative** from settlement-related budget lines
- The Neemanei Torah V'Avodah investigation revealed that settlement funds designated for peripheral areas were directed to central Tel Aviv operations
- Housing Ministry head of Neighborhood Rehabilitation testified that "Rabbi Dorfman circulated through the Housing Ministry calling himself head of the Torah Core Groups administration"

### Budget Flow Pattern

The funding pattern shows a classic Religious-Zionist kernel financing structure:
1. MoE funds for "Jewish culture" and "educational nucleus" -- legitimate-sounding categories
2. Settlement Division funds for "settlement management" -- redirected to urban Torah kernel operations
3. Housing Ministry funds for "neighborhood rehabilitation" -- used for cultural center in affluent Tel Aviv
4. Agriculture Ministry funds for "urban settlement management" -- a creative budget line

---

## 8. FOREIGN FUNDING

**No direct evidence found** of funding from NIF, Abraham Fund, US Jewish federations, or other progressive/liberal funders. This is consistent with the organization's Religious-Zionist orientation -- these funders typically support pluralist or progressive organizations, not Orthodox kiruv operations.

The Charidy fundraising platform has a campaign page for HaMakom/Rabbi Dorfman (https://www.charidy.com/hamakom-6/1), suggesting private philanthropic fundraising, likely from Religious-Zionist donors in Israel and abroad.

Given the 9M+ annual revenue and ~5M government funding over 3 years, there is a significant gap that must be filled by donations. The likely sources are:
- Religious-Zionist philanthropists in Israel
- American Orthodox/Religious-Zionist donors
- Charidy campaigns
- Program fees and event revenue

---

## 9. CONTROVERSIES AND MEDIA COVERAGE

### 2018 Yedioth Ahronoth Investigation ("Malkahaim Movement")

The most significant investigative piece, published in Yedioth Ahronoth (Israel's largest newspaper), alleged:

1. **Fund misallocation:** Settlement Division funds meant for peripheral, disadvantaged communities were channeled to Chevruta in affluent central Tel Aviv
2. **Political connections:** The organization served as an operational arm for the Komemiyut political caucus
3. **Personal enrichment:** Rabbi Dorfman and his wife received "hundreds of thousands of shekels" in salaries; Rabbi Kartman personally loaned the org money
4. **Financial distress:** Despite government funding, the org reported severe deficits and took extensive loans in 2015

### Neemanei Torah V'Avodah Investigation

This Religious-Zionist watchdog organization published findings about the Housing Ministry's 110M NIS annual allocation to settlement kernels, specifically noting that "the Housing Ministry admits they have no idea how 100 million shekels transferred to the Settlement Division were distributed." Chevruta/Dorfman were specifically named as recipients of 700K NIS/year from this opaque process.

### "Religiousization" (Hadatah) Debate

The broader ecosystem of Torah kernels in secular cities -- including Chevruta's operations -- is a central topic in Israel's "religiousization" debate. Critics argue these organizations receive government funds to promote Orthodox religious observance in secular communities under the guise of "Jewish culture." Defenders argue they fill a genuine demand for Jewish identity content.

## 11. VALUES ALIGNMENT TABLE

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Transparency | 2/5 | Opaque funding flows; Settlement Division funds to central Tel Aviv; severe deficit hidden until forced disclosure |
| Pluralism | 2/5 | Claims to bridge secular-religious; but Orthodox framework, Rav Kook ideology, anti-LGBTQ views |
| Democratic values | 2/5 | Connected to Komemiyut movement; board member is Smotrich brother; settlement ideology |
| Educational quality | 3/5 | 200+ weekly participants suggest genuine demand; post-10/7 surge in interest |
| Financial responsibility | 2/5 | Severe deficits, extensive loans, salary controversies, fund misallocation allegations |
| Anti-racism (claimed theme) | ?/5 | "0% Indifference" program exists but no content details found; unclear if anti-racism is substantive or performative |

---

## 12. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. **What is the actual content of "0% Indifference" and "Direct Encounter"?** These Gefen programs could not be found online. Are they genuinely anti-racist, or do they frame "encounters" through a Religious-Zionist identity lens?

2. **Who are the private donors?** The gap between government funding and total revenue suggests significant private philanthropy. Are there US 501(c)(3) entities channeling funds?

3. **What is the current board composition?** GuideStar pages could not be scraped. Is Akiva Smotrich still on the board?

4. **What is the Rosh Yehudi / Chevruta / HaMakom corporate structure?** Are these three names for functionally the same operation, or genuinely separate entities sharing space?

5. **Has the State Comptroller ever audited Chevruta specifically?** The broader Torah kernel funding mechanism has been flagged but individual org audits are unknown.

6. **What is the relationship between the school programs and the core HaMakom activities?** Are schools being used as a pipeline to HaMakom programming?
