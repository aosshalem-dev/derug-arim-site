## Executive Summary

"קריבוס אור" is a **sole proprietor (עוסק מורשה)** operating as an external business-sector supplier in Israel's Ministry of Education Gefen catalog. The entity runs a single program called "שפיץ לבני נוער — תכנית העצמה אישית וקבוצתית" (Shpitz for Youth — Personal and Group Empowerment Program), registered as **Gefen program #5964**. The business registration number is **36415149**.

The operator is most likely **Or Krybus (אור קריבוס)**, an individual who also appears on LinkedIn as an "Innovation Developer and Implementer, Project Manager" at **ORT Israel** (רשת אורט ישראל), with education from **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev** and based in **Ramat Gan**. The Krybus family appears to include several notable professionals in Israel (Michael Krybus — Visual Pathways time management; Shmulik Krybus — Deloitte director; Prof. Avi Krybus — TAU engineering), though a confirmed family relationship between them has not been established.

**Key finding:** This is a one-person business selling empowerment coaching to schools via the Gefen system. There is **no evidence** of feminist, gender, social justice, or political content in the program. The methodology appears to be generic life-coaching/mentoring with goals like self-confidence, goal-setting, and violence prevention. The program operates at very small scale (budget ₪17,200 across 4 cities, 5 schools) and carries **low ideological risk** but **moderate transparency risk** due to the opaque sole-proprietor structure.

## 2. What is "שפיץ" (Shpitz)?

### Program Details (from Gefen Catalog — 2school.co.il)

- **Route:** במכרז המאגר (Tender Pool)
- **Ministry Framework:** הכלה והשתלבות (Inclusion and Integration)

- **Budget:** ₪17,200 total across 4 cities, 5 schools (per user's data)

### Program Description (as stated in catalog)
The program describes itself as a "unique program helping participants identify their uniqueness among peers, build strong self-identity, identify their strengths and inspire those around them."

### Stated Goals
1. Significantly improve academic and social capabilities
2. Create a winning school climate
3. Find personal uniqueness
4. Develop sense of competence and high self-worth
5. Take personal and social responsibility
6. Reduce cases of violence and encourage community spirit
7. Set goals and achieve them
8. Strengthen family relationships
9. Create an optimal climate in the participant's environment
10. Build proper community conduct
11. Standing before an audience and self-advocacy

---

## 3. Does "Empowerment" Include Feminist/Gender/Social Justice Content?

### Finding: NO EVIDENCE of ideological content

Based on extensive searching:
- The program description uses "העצמה" (empowerment) strictly in the personal/psychological sense: self-confidence, self-worth, goal-setting, violence prevention
- **No mention of:** feminism, gender, sexuality, social justice, equality, rights, political awareness, activism, identity politics
- The Ministry framework is "הכלה והשתלבות" (Inclusion and Integration) — this is a standard MoE category for programs that help students with integration difficulties, not an ideological designation
- The subject area "חברתי - ערכי" (Social-Values) is the generic MoE category for programs addressing social skills and basic values

### Comparison with Known Ideological Programs
Unlike programs from organizations like Shaar Shivion (שער שוויון) or Meyda Amin (מידע אמין), which explicitly focus on gender identity and social justice, this program's language is entirely about generic personal development. The catalog tags do not include any gender, feminist, or social justice terminology.

## 4. Financial Structure

### Budget Scale
- **Total known budget:** ₪17,200 (per user's data)
- **Deployment:** 4 cities, 5 schools
- **Average per school:** ~₪3,440

This is an extremely small operation. For context:
- Typical Gefen programs range from ₪5,000 to ₪50,000+ per school
- ₪17,200 total suggests minimal hours per school (possibly 5-10 sessions total)
- The budget suggests this is supplementary income for an individual, not a primary business

### Financial Transparency
- **As a sole proprietor (עוסק מורשה), there are NO public financial disclosure requirements** — unlike amutot which must file with the Registrar of Associations
- No GuideStar page exists
- No obudget.org records found
- The business number (36415149) appears to be a personal ID number used as a business registration, not a corporate entity number

### Revenue Estimation
- ₪17,200 across 5 schools is the only known revenue from Gefen
- The individual also works at ORT Israel (per LinkedIn), suggesting this is a side business
- No other Gefen programs registered under this business number

## 5. Leadership

### Or Krybus — Profile Reconstruction
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Name** | Or Krybus (אור קריבוס) |
| **Primary employment** | Innovation Developer and Implementer, Project Manager — ORT Israel |
| **Education** | Ben-Gurion University of the Negev |
| **Location** | Ramat Gan |
| **Side business** | "קריבוס אור" — Gefen supplier (עוסק מורשה #36415149) |
| **Program** | "שפיץ לבני נוער" — Gefen #5964 |
| **Contact** | 345mail@gmail.com, WhatsApp: +972-52-830-8144 |

### ORT Israel Connection
ORT Israel is one of Israel's largest educational networks, focused on technology and science education. Or Krybus's title — "Innovation Developer and Implementer" — suggests a role in developing educational programs or tools. It is plausible that the "שפיץ" program was developed as a personal side project leveraging education sector experience. ORT Israel recently took over operation of the new Navon campus in Hadera.

### Krybus Family in Israel (possible connections — NOT confirmed as relatives)
- **Michael Krybus (מיכאל קריבוס)** — Author of "Visual Pathways" / "איך להפוך מצב לארנב", time management and project management consultant, 32 years in tech, lectures since 2018 to 6,000+ attendees
- **Shmulik Krybus (שמוליק קריבוס)** — Director at Deloitte Israel, 17+ years in IT and project management, leads healthcare sector and managed services
- **Prof. Avi Krybus (אברהם קריבוס)** — Faculty at Tel Aviv University, School of Mechanical Engineering, renewable energy researcher

The surname "קריבוס" is uncommon in Israel. The concentration of Krybus individuals in technology, project management, and consulting is notable. Whether these are direct family members is unconfirmed.

### Note: Aviram Shpitz — NOT the same entity
A separate web search revealed "אבירם שפיץ" who runs "שפיץ — אימון וחיזוק מנטלי" (mental coaching) from Hadera since 2012. This is a DIFFERENT business — a mental coach for athletes and business owners, not the Gefen program. The name "שפיץ" in the Gefen program appears to be an independent branding choice by Or Krybus, not a franchise of Aviram Shpitz's business.

## 6. Target Audience

### As Stated in Gefen Catalog
- **Grades:** 5th through 14th (elementary through post-high-school)
- **Population type:** The catalog lists it under "הכלה והשתלבות" (Inclusion and Integration), which typically covers:
  - Students with integration difficulties
  - At-risk youth
  - Students from disadvantaged backgrounds
  - Students with special needs in mainstream settings

### Analysis
The program tags include "dropout prevention" and "violence prevention" alongside "leadership" and "life skills." This dual targeting (both at-risk and general population) is common in Gefen programs — it allows the supplier to serve any school regardless of student population.

The ₪17,200 budget across 5 schools suggests the program is being purchased as a supplementary enrichment, not as a core intervention for at-risk students.

---

## 7. Government Approval — Gefen Status

### Gefen Catalog Approval
- **Status:** Listed in the Gefen catalog (הקטלוג לתוכניות גפן)
- **Route:** במכרז המאגר (Tender Pool) — meaning the program went through the standard Gefen approval process
- **Program number:** 5964

### What Gefen Approval Means
Gefen (גפ"ן — גמישות פדגוגית ניהולית) is the Ministry of Education's framework for giving school principals flexibility to choose educational programs. To enter the Gefen catalog:
1. The supplier submits a program proposal
2. The proposal is reviewed for alignment with MoE educational goals
3. If approved, the program appears in the catalog
4. Individual schools can then choose to purchase it

**Important caveats:**
- Gefen approval does NOT mean the MoE endorses the program content
- Gefen approval does NOT mean the program has been evaluated for effectiveness
- The MoE allocates ~₪11,500 per student to schools, and principals choose how to spend it
- There is no mandatory evaluation or outcome reporting
- Any registered business (עוסק מורשה, חברה, עמותה) can apply

### Comparison to Other Programs
The program is classified as:
- **Framework:** הכלה והשתלבות (same category as programs for students with disabilities and integration needs)
- **Subject:** חברתי - ערכי (same category as both neutral life-skills programs and ideologically-charged programs)

---

## 8. Connections to Other Organizations

### Direct Connections Found
- **ORT Israel** — Or Krybus's primary employer. ORT is a major educational network (not itself ideological in the relevant sense). The connection is employment, not program endorsement.

### Connections NOT Found
- No connection to any feminist, gender, or social justice organizations
- No connection to known empowerment/activist networks
- No connection to Shaar Shivion, Meyda Amin, or similar organizations from previous research
- No connection to known social change movements
- No connection to foreign funding sources
- No connection to NIF, Ford Foundation, or similar funders

### Network Absence
The most notable finding is the **absence of a network.** Unlike organizations like ACRI, Dror Israel, or Gesher — which have extensive cross-organizational connections, board interlocks, and funding chains — "קריבוס אור" appears to be an isolated individual business with no discernible organizational network.

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Rating: LOW (1.5/5) — Lower Than Initially Assigned

The initial risk rating of 3/5 may have been based on:
- The word "העצמה" (empowerment) in the program name
- The unknown operator identity
- The sole-proprietor opacity

After research, the risk factors break down as:

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Ideological content** | 1/5 | No evidence of feminist, gender, or social justice content |
| **Financial opacity** | 3/5 | Sole proprietor = zero public financial transparency |
| **Scale of influence** | 1/5 | ₪17,200 across 5 schools = minimal footprint |
| **Organizational network** | 1/5 | No connections to activist/NGO networks |
| **Methodology transparency** | 2/5 | No named methodology, no facilitator qualifications listed |
| **Digital presence** | 2/5 | Near-zero online footprint — cannot verify claims |

### Key Risks
1. **Opacity:** Cannot verify what actually happens in sessions because there is no website, no testimonials, no methodology documentation, and no evaluation reports
2. **Unqualified facilitator risk:** No facilitator qualifications are listed. Is Or Krybus personally running sessions? With what training?
3. **Side-project risk:** This appears to be a side business for someone whose primary job is at ORT Israel. Commitment and quality may be limited.

### Key Mitigants
1. Tiny scale — even if problematic, impact is minimal
2. Generic empowerment language — no ideological red flags
3. Gefen catalog listing provides minimal quality floor
4. The ORT Israel connection suggests education sector experience

---

## Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **What are Or Krybus's coaching/facilitation qualifications?** The Gefen listing shows no requirements. Does Or Krybus have formal training in group facilitation, therapy, coaching, or education?
2. **What is the actual session content?** The catalog description is generic. What activities, exercises, and discussions actually occur in sessions?
3. **Is this a one-person operation?** Does Or Krybus personally facilitate all sessions, or are there sub-contracted facilitators?
4. **What is the relationship between this side business and ORT Israel employment?** Does ORT know/approve? Is there any overlap?
5. **How was the program evaluated for Gefen approval?** What documentation was submitted?
6. **Which 4 cities and 5 schools are currently using this program?**
