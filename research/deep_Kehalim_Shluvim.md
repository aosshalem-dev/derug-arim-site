## Executive Summary

Kehalim Shluvim is a small public benefit company (chelatz) that serves as the social/educational arm of **Goma Gevim** (formerly Gevim Group), a commercial mediation and coaching firm founded in 1996 by Omri Gafen following the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The company was explicitly founded from a "social change" motivation tied to the Rabin assassination, and the mediation field in Israel is deeply intertwined with the post-Rabin peace/dialogue movement. While the program's surface content -- teaching children dialogue and mediation skills -- appears benign, its founding ideology, organizational network, and the unusual 7-flag trigger in Gefen warrant careful examination. The company is tiny (384K NIS revenue, 0 reported employees) but operates through schools using Ministry of Education Gefen catalog funding, gaining access to classrooms across sectors.

**Note:** The chelatz structure (vs. amuta) gives this entity the corporate governance of a company -- shareholders, directors -- while maintaining non-profit status. This is the same structure used by entities that want to combine commercial activity with public benefit designation.

## 2. Finances

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Annual revenue (2025 report)** | 384,143 NIS |
| **Sector median** | 1,345,480 NIS |
| **Government transfers (last 3 years)** | 0 NIS documented |
| **Employees** | 0 (reported) |
| **Volunteers** | 0 (reported) |

**Source:** [Obudget entity page](https://next.obudget.org/i/org/association/515521748)

### Analysis

The financial picture is puzzling:
- **384K NIS revenue** is extremely small for an org claiming 100+ classrooms nationwide, operations from Deir Hanna/Sakhnin to Eilat, partnerships with Bank Leumi, and a full-time CEO.
- **0 employees / 0 volunteers reported** -- yet the website lists a CEO (Zvika Shahar), a pedagogical director (Ofir Abigdori), a legal advisor (Shay Brand), plus the founders. Either the staff are compensated through Goma Gevim (the parent commercial entity) or reporting is incomplete.
- **0 government transfers** in 3 years -- yet the 70,199 NIS in Gefen catalog is Ministry of Education money flowing through school budgets to the supplier. This is technically a school-to-supplier payment, not a direct government transfer, which may explain why Obudget shows zero.
- The real money likely flows through **Goma Gevim / Gevim Group** (the commercial entities), with Kehalim Shluvim acting as a non-profit front/channel for school-system access that a for-profit company would not easily get through Gefen.

### Funding model
The Gefen (GaPaN) catalog system works as follows: the Ministry of Education allocates a flexible budget to each school, schools choose programs from the Gefen catalog, and schools pay suppliers directly. So the 70,199 NIS in the user's data represents payments from 8 schools in 5 cities. This money comes from public funds but is routed through school budgets, not direct government transfers.

### Leadership pattern
The entire leadership team comes from Goma Gevim / Gevim Group. There is **no independent board** -- the chelatz's shareholders and directors are the same people who run the commercial parent entity. This is a classic pattern: a commercial training company creates a non-profit subsidiary to access government-funded education markets.

## 4. Programs: What Are They Actually Teaching?

### Gefen catalog listing
- **Program #9281:** "גישור ודיאלוג" (Mediation and Dialogue for Life Skills)
- **Rating:** 3/5 (org_inherited -- meaning the rating is inherited from the organization, not earned by the specific program)

### Program content (from website, Ynet article, Tzomet HaSharon article)

**Three target groups:**
1. **All students** -- Workshops on dialogue, mediation, consensus-building, listening, conflict analysis, cooperation, win-win solutions, communication
2. **Selected student mediators** -- 30-hour certification course producing school mediators who staff "mediation rooms" (חדרי גישור)
3. **Teachers & parents** -- Professional development workshops; digital mediation course (online, self-paced)

**Age range:** Kindergarten (age 3+) through 12th grade
**Sectors:** State, state-religious, ultra-Orthodox, Arab (Hebrew & Arabic)
**Geographic claim:** From Deir Hanna/Sakhnin in the north to Eilat in the south

### "Shvil HaPiyus" (שביל הפיוס -- Path of Reconciliation)
- A physical PVC mat (1.1m x 2.5m) with printed dialogue instructions
- Children walk along the path, tell their story, listen, and resolve disputes
- Available for kindergartens, schools, homes, and parks
- Also available in Arabic (الطريق الى الصُلح)
- Sold commercially through meshulam.co.il
- Separate website: [shvilhapius.co.il](https://shvilhapius.co.il/)

### Content assessment

The **surface content** is standard conflict resolution / mediation education. The techniques described -- active listening, expressing positions, finding agreements, win-win framing -- come from the mediation/NVC (Nonviolent Communication) tradition.

**However, the "social change" framing is persistent and explicit:**
- The company name itself: "לשינוי חברתי" (for social change)
- Omri Gafen founded the movement after Rabin's assassination specifically to change Israeli society
- The Tzomet HaSharon article states the program was "established by Omri Gafen after Rabin's assassination"
- Repeated language about "חברה שסועה" (fractured society), "נגועה באלימות" (afflicted with violence), "קושי בהדברות" (difficulty in dialogue)
- The explicit goal is to "change the discourse culture in the State of Israel" (לשנות את תרבות השיח במדינת ישראל)

**What could trigger 7 theme flags simultaneously?**
Without seeing the specific flags, a mediation/dialogue program that explicitly aims to "change discourse culture" across all sectors (including Arab sector, in Arabic) could plausibly trigger flags related to:
1. Social-emotional learning (SEL)
2. Conflict resolution / peace education
3. Values education
4. Multicultural / shared society
5. Anti-violence / anti-bullying
6. Life skills
7. Democratic citizenship / discourse culture

Seven flags for a single program is highly unusual and suggests the program's content spans multiple categories that individually might be uncontroversial but collectively indicate a broad social engineering agenda.

---

## 5. Ideology: What "Social Change"? What Direction?

### The founding narrative

The origin story is told repeatedly and consistently:
- In **1994**, Omri Gafen began working in mediation
- Following **Rabin's assassination (November 4, 1995)**, he founded **Gevim Group in 1996** as what he calls "the first social enterprise in Israel"
- His vision: "consciousness-and-action-based change" (שינוי מבוסס תודעה ומעשה)
- Gevim was "the first organization in Israel that worked to develop mediation and implement the language in many systems"

This places the entire enterprise squarely in the **post-Rabin peace movement** tradition. The Rabin assassination is the explicit founding trauma and motivation. The unstated but clear implication: Israeli society's "discourse culture" is broken (evidenced by the assassination), and must be changed through systematic education starting from kindergarten.

### Buzzword analysis

From the website and press:
- "שינוי חברתי" (social change) -- in the company name
- "תרבות השיח" (discourse culture) -- the primary target for change
- "חברה שסועה" (fractured/divided society)
- "חוסן" (resilience) -- co-opted from security/psychological discourse
- "קבלת האחר" (acceptance of the other) -- standard shared-society language
- "חיים משותפים" (shared life) -- used by shared-society movement
- "שיתופיות" (collaboration/cooperation) -- Gafen's book title and core concept
- Teaching in Arabic and Hebrew "in all sectors" -- shared society framing

### Semantic displacement check

The word "גישור" (mediation) in standard legal/commercial Hebrew means a structured process of dispute resolution between specific parties with a neutral third party. The way Kehalim Shluvim uses it, "גישור" becomes a broader social philosophy -- a way of life ("דרך חיים"), a tool for societal transformation, a means to create "shared lives" between divided communities. This is a significant semantic expansion: from a professional technique to a social ideology.

Similarly, "דיאלוג" (dialogue) shifts from its neutral meaning (conversation between parties) to carrying the specific post-Rabin connotation of Jewish-Arab / left-right rapprochement dialogue programs.

### Hebrew vs. English messaging
No significant English-language presence was found. The organization operates almost entirely in Hebrew (with some Arabic for Arab-sector schools). There is no fundraising presence in English, no US entity, no attempt to market internationally. This is a purely domestic operation.

## 6. Network Connections

### Parent organization: Goma Gevim / Gevim Group

The relationship is not parent-subsidiary in a legal sense, but in practice:

| Entity | Type | Founded | Role |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| **Gevim Group (קבוצת גבים)** | Commercial | 1996 | Original mediation firm founded by Omri Gafen. Now redirects to Goma Gevim. |
| **Goma Gevim (גומא גבים)** | Commercial | ~2020 (merger/rebrand) | "Center for Mediation, Coaching and Cooperation." College offering NLP, mediation, coaching, family studies, TAC certification. |
| **Kehalim Shluvim (קהלים שלובים)** | Chelatz (non-profit) | 2017 | Education-sector arm. Listed on Goma Gevim website as a division/project. Shares all leadership with Goma Gevim. |
| **Shvil HaPiyus (שביל הפיוס)** | Product brand | Unknown | Physical mat product for conflict resolution. Has own website. Connected to Kehalim Shluvim. |

**Goma Gevim website explicitly lists "קהלים שלובים" as one of its social projects** at [gomegevim.co.il/social/social_audience/](https://www.gomegevim.co.il/social/social_audience/).

### Wider mediation/dialogue network

Omri Gafen is deeply embedded in the Israeli mediation field:
- Lecturer at **Tel Aviv University** (Executive Leadership Program)
- Lecturer at **Ben-Gurion University** (Conflict Management program)
- Lecturer at **IDC Herzliya** (MA Social and Organizational Psychology)
- Author of **"The Power of Collaboration"** (English: Routledge 2024; Hebrew: Matar 2021 as "עוצמת השיתופיות")
- Recognized as one of the leaders of the "mediation movement" in Israel
- Partner at **Goma Gevim**, which is a recognized school by **Israel Coaches Chamber (לשכת המאמנים)**

### NVC (Nonviolent Communication) connection
No direct organizational link to the NVC movement (העמותה לתקשורת מקרבת) was found. However, the methodology (dialogue-based conflict resolution, listening, needs-based communication) is closely aligned with NVC principles. The mediation field in Israel has significant overlap with the NVC community.

### Corporate partner
- **Bank Leumi** -- trained ~40 employees as volunteer mediators through Kehalim Shluvim

### Digital partner
- **Yschool** -- collaborated on the digital mediation course

## 7. Media Coverage

| Date | Source | Type | Key Content |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| March 13, 2023 | **Ynet** | Sponsored content (תוכן פרסומי) | Interview with Elisha Mazali and Omri Gafen. Program overview, digital course announcement, awareness event for March 19. Claims "all sectors." |
| July 12, 2023 | **Tzomet HaSharon Herzliya** | Local news article | Reporter Mazal Talbi Levy. Program "revolutionizes discourse culture." States 100+ classrooms in 2022-2023. Founding after Rabin assassination mentioned. Elisha Mazali interview. |
| Undated | **Goma Gevim site** | Organization page | Lists Kehalim Shluvim as social project of Goma Gevim. |

**Notable:** The Ynet article is explicitly labeled "sponsored content" (תוכן פרסומי), meaning it was paid for. The Tzomet HaSharon article reads like a press release rewrite -- no critical analysis, no other sources. **No independent investigative or critical coverage was found.**

No academic citations were found linking to Kehalim Shluvim or its programs. No evaluation studies of program effectiveness were found.

## 8. Risk Assessment & Red Flags

### Structural concerns

1. **Shell-company pattern:** A commercial mediation/coaching firm (Goma Gevim) created a non-profit (Kehalim Shluvim) to access public education funding through the Gefen catalog. The non-profit reports 0 employees and minimal revenue, while the commercial parent does the actual work. This is a known pattern for extracting public money through non-profit channels.

2. **No independent governance:** All directors/shareholders of the chelatz are also leaders of the commercial parent. There is no independent board oversight.

3. **Financial opacity:** 384K NIS in revenue with 0 employees and 0 volunteers is internally contradictory for an organization claiming 100+ classrooms. Where does the money go? Through Goma Gevim?

4. **7 simultaneous theme flags** is the highest flag count in the Gefen dataset -- this suggests the program's content touches an unusually broad range of sensitive educational themes.

5. **org_inherited rating (3/5):** The program's Gefen rating is inherited from the organization rather than earned through program-specific evaluation. This means the program content itself has not been independently evaluated.

### Ideological concerns

6. **Explicit social change mandate:** The company exists to "change the discourse culture" of the State of Israel. This is not a neutral educational service -- it is an explicitly transformative agenda.

7. **Post-Rabin founding mythology:** The founding narrative explicitly ties the organization to the Rabin assassination and the subsequent peace/dialogue movement. This is a political origin, not an educational one.

8. **All-sector penetration:** The program explicitly targets secular, religious, ultra-Orthodox, and Arab schools in Hebrew and Arabic. The goal is society-wide transformation, not serving a specific need.

9. **Kindergarten-to-12th-grade pipeline:** Starting at age 3 and continuing through high school ensures maximum exposure time for ideological formation.

### What's missing

10. **No published curriculum:** The actual lesson plans, materials, and content are not publicly available for review.
11. **No independent evaluation:** No academic study, no impact assessment, no third-party review of what happens in the classroom.
12. **No critical media coverage:** Only paid/sponsored content and press-release-style local coverage.

---

## 9. Values Alignment Table

| Value | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Transparency** | 2/5 | Chelatz structure with 0-employee reporting; no published curriculum; financial flow unclear |
| **Independence from commercial interests** | 1/5 | Fully controlled by commercial parent Goma Gevim; same leadership, same address |
| **Educational neutrality** | 2/5 | "Social change" in the name; post-Rabin founding narrative; all-sector transformation agenda |
| **Financial proportionality** | 3/5 | Small amounts (70K in Gefen); but opacity about real revenue/cost structure |
| **Evidence base** | 1/5 | No published research, no evaluation, no academic citation |
| **Governance quality** | 2/5 | No independent trustees separate from management; standard chelatz minimum |

---

## 10. Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **What is the actual financial relationship between Kehalim Shluvim and Goma Gevim?** Does revenue pass through? Are staff employed by Goma Gevim but deployed through Kehalim Shluvim?
2. **What are the specific 7 theme flags?** This would clarify what content areas the program touches.
3. **Is there a published curriculum or teacher's guide** that can be reviewed for political content?
4. **What do the "mediation rooms" in schools actually look like?** Are conflicts being "mediated" using a specific ideological framework?
5. **What was the scope expansion after October 7, 2023?** The organization's narrative about "divided society" and "discourse culture" would have intensified post-war.
6. **Are there connections to other post-Rabin dialogue organizations** (e.g., Givat Haviva, Hand in Hand, Merchavim, ACRI)?
7. **Why chelatz and not amuta?** The chelatz structure provides certain advantages (shareholder control, less regulatory oversight than amuta) -- was this a deliberate choice?
