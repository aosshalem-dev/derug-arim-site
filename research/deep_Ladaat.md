## Executive Summary

**Thesis:** "Ladaat — Choose Well" (לדעת — לבחור נכון) is one of the oldest and most established sexuality-education organizations in Israel, founded in 1976 as a pregnancy counseling service (SHILA) and evolving over nearly five decades into a comprehensive sexual health and reproductive rights advocacy organization centered in Jerusalem. Unlike the commercial sole-proprietorship operators in the Gefen sex-ed cluster (Meyda Amin, Maga BeTiaum), Ladaat operates as a registered amuta (nonprofit association) with full GuideStar transparency, a professional board chaired by Dr. Shulamit Shulov-Barkan, and a reported annual turnover of NIS 1.35M (2024). The organization delivers 800+ workshops annually in ~30 Jerusalem schools, runs a free anonymous counseling center (6,000+ consultations since 2018), and maintains social media outreach in Hebrew and Arabic. Its CEO, Dina Shalev (MSW, Hebrew University), is an active reproductive-rights advocate who leads "Forum 21" — a coalition pushing to abolish Israel's pregnancy termination committees — and who publicly opposed the November 2025 Knesset "Until Marriage" conference. The organization is a member of the Israeli Association for Sex Education (SEI), placing it in the same professional network as Meyda Amin and Maga BeTiaum. While its sex-education content is framed around consent, equality, and bodily autonomy (standard progressive Western norms), its dual role as both an educational provider and a political advocacy organization for reproductive rights and against conservative sex-ed approaches warrants attention.

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM. Ladaat is the most transparent entity in the Jerusalem sex-ed cluster. Its amuta status, 48-year track record, multidisciplinary professional team, and GuideStar compliance distinguish it from sole-proprietorship operators. However, the organization's explicit political advocacy (Forum 21, anti-abortion-committee campaigns, public opposition to conservative education) positions it as a partisan actor in the sexuality education space, not a neutral educational provider.

**Note on founding dates:** The organization's website and Wikipedia say "founded 1976." obudget.org shows registration year 1983. The likely explanation: SHILA began operations informally in 1976 and formally registered as an amuta in 1983.

## 5. Ideology & Content Analysis

### Core Ideological Framework

Ladaat explicitly states four foundational principles:
1. **Access to reliable information** about sexuality and reproduction
2. **Freedom of self-expression** regarding sexuality and relationships without fear
3. **Autonomy** in choices regarding relationships, sexuality, and reproduction
4. **Consent** as the basis for all sexual behavior — encompassing desire, mutual respect, and knowledge

The organization promotes "education for mutuality, equality, body literacy, and informed decision-making" (from SEI listing).

### Progressive Positioning

Ladaat's framework is standard progressive/comprehensive sex education aligned with WHO and UNESCO guidelines. Key markers:
- Consent-centered approach
- Body autonomy and bodily literacy
- Critical thinking about gender norms
- Pornography literacy (not abstinence from pornography but critical engagement)
- Reproductive rights advocacy (pro-choice stance clearly articulated through Forum 21)

### LGBTQ+ Content

**Not explicitly detailed** on the organization's public-facing materials. The SEI association page lists goals including "creating social discourse and promoting political thinking on issues of sexual health and the factors that shape perceptions about sexuality, masculinity, femininity, and gender roles." The Instagram account (@ladaat.choose.well) likely includes LGBTQ+-affirming content based on the organization's progressive positioning and SEI membership, but specific curricula or workshop outlines addressing sexual orientation or gender identity were not found in public sources.

**Comparison:** Meyda Amin explicitly includes LGBTQ+ affirmation and gender identity exploration in its curriculum. Ladaat is more cautious in its public marketing, possibly because of its Jerusalem location and diverse constituency including Arab communities.

### Conservative Alternatives Comparison

| Dimension | Ladaat (Progressive) | "Until Marriage" (Conservative) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Core principle | Informed choice | Abstinence until marriage |
| Consent framing | Active, ongoing consent model | Sexuality within marriage = consent |
| Contraception | Taught and counseled | Discouraged or not addressed |
| LGBTQ+ | Implicitly affirming | Not addressed or opposed |
| Target population | All youth regardless of religion | Primarily religious/traditional communities |
| Political advocacy | Forum 21, pro-choice | Lobby for religious women, Knesset conference |
| Criticism received | "Undermining family values" | "Degrading analogies" (sticker metaphor at Nov 2025 Knesset) |

## 6. Network Analysis

### Israeli Association for Sex Education (SEI) Membership

Ladaat is a member of the האגודה לחינוך מיני (Israeli Association for Sex Education), which functions as a professional body and network for sex-education providers. Other notable members in the same network:

| Organization | Gefen Connection | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **מידע אמין על מין** (Meyda Amin) | Gefen #2437 | Sole proprietorship, NIS 1.18M, 40 facilitators, 15 cities |
| **מגע בתיאום בע"מ** (Maga BeTiaum) | Gefen #2930, #3027 | Private company (בע"מ), NIS 453K, 7 cities |
| **לדעת לבחור נכון** (Ladaat) | Gefen #992 | Registered amuta, NIS 1.35M, Jerusalem focus |
| לבוא — לדבר מין ההתחלה | SEI member | Sex ed from early childhood |
| נקודת מפגש | SEI member | "Sexuality at eye level" |
| לדבר על זה | SEI member | Comprehensive sex ed initiative |
| תהודה | SEI member | "Sexuality Education Like This" program |
| לגעת בזה, המעורר | SEI member | Touch/awakening framework |

**Total SEI members:** 28 organizations (including support centers for sexual assault victims, LGBTQ+ orgs, and academic institutions)

**Source:** SEI organizations index — https://sei.org.il/organizations/

### Formal Connections to Meyda Amin and Maga BeTiaum

- All three are SEI members sharing its "vision, goals, and code of ethics"
- The Maga BeTiaum research report (batch 2) explicitly identified Ladaat as part of "the cluster" alongside Meyda Amin
- SEI serves as a self-certifying professional body — Ladaat's facilitators are trained to SEI standards, and SEI membership is held by all three Gefen sex-ed providers
- Shiri Basin Savion (Maga BeTiaum's professional director) moved from the Ministry of Education's sexuality unit — this revolving door touches the same ecosystem that certifies Ladaat's facilitators

### Key Distinction

Unlike Meyda Amin (sole proprietorship) and Maga BeTiaum (private company), Ladaat is the only registered amuta in this cluster with:
- Public GuideStar filings
- A named board of directors
- Transparent financial reporting requirements
- Nearly 50 years of institutional history

## 7. Controversies & Criticisms

### Direct Controversies

**No major public controversies found targeting Ladaat specifically.** Unlike Meyda Amin (whose founder's "Achat Mitoch Achat" database of 1,800 alleged perpetrators drew attention), Ladaat has maintained a relatively low-controversy profile over its 48-year history.

### Indirect/Contextual Controversies

1. **Conservative pushback on sex education generally:** The November 2025 "Until Marriage" (עד החתונה) Knesset conference — organized by MK Limor Son Har Melekh's lobby — represents the conservative counter-movement. Dina Shalev's public Ynet rebuttal placed Ladaat squarely in the political crosshairs of this debate.

2. **Gender Critical Israel (ג'נדר קריטיקל ישראל):** This website publishes critical content about gender-ideology education in schools. While Ladaat is not specifically named in their critiques (as far as discoverable), the broader sex-ed ecosystem it belongs to is under scrutiny from this perspective.

3. **Haredi community exclusion:** The Shomrim investigative report documents that ~400,000 Haredi children receive zero sex education. Ladaat's Jerusalem location places it at the geographic center of this tension, but it does not appear to operate in Haredi schools.

4. **Reproductive rights advocacy as political activism:** Ladaat's leadership of Forum 21 (the coalition to abolish pregnancy termination committees) and its explicit pro-choice advocacy through Knesset engagement positions it as a political actor, not merely an educational provider. This dual role is relevant for parents evaluating whether the organization delivers neutral education or ideologically driven content.

5. **Services to minors without parental consent:** The counseling center explicitly provides services "without parental consent for minors." While this is standard practice for sexual health counseling in many Western countries, it may concern parents who expect to be informed of their children's engagement with sexuality-related services.

### No documented:
- Lawsuits
- State Comptroller findings
- Parent complaint campaigns
- Media scandals
- Financial irregularities

---

## 8. Scope & Geographic Reach

### Jerusalem Core

- **~30 schools** in Jerusalem (per English website)
- **800+ workshops per year** across these schools and other frameworks
- **33,000 adolescents** reached since 2018 (cumulative)
- **6,000 consultations** provided since 2018

### Beyond Schools

The organization operates in:
- Secondary schools (7th–12th grade)
- Hostels (מעונות)
- NGO frameworks
- At-risk youth programs (מסגרות נוער בסיכון)
- Boarding schools (פנימיות)
- Municipal services
- IDF courses
- Community centers
- Informal education settings
- Women's homes ("Parlour Meetings")
- Street outreach (Mobile Counseling Unit for homeless youth and sex workers)

### Arab Community Reach

Ladaat explicitly serves Arabic-speaking populations:
- Arabic Instagram account
- Arabic counseling services (led by Bian Ragabi and Fatina Husseini)
- Arabic workshops in formal and informal settings

### National Reach via Digital

The organization's social media presence (Instagram, TikTok) extends its reach nationally beyond its Jerusalem physical footprint.

### Gefen Footprint

Gefen program #992 is listed in the Ministry of Education's catalog, allowing any school in Israel to select it. However, the actual deployment appears concentrated in Jerusalem and surrounding areas. The exact number of cities and schools using program #992 through Gefen was not found in public mapping data.

---

## 12. Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Specific curricula:** What exactly is taught in each workshop? Lesson plans are not publicly available. A parent seeking to review content before their child participates would have difficulty doing so.

2. **LGBTQ+ content specifics:** The organization's position on gender identity education is not explicitly stated in public materials. Does program #992 include gender identity content? Sexual orientation content? At what ages?

3. **Gefen deployment data:** How many schools outside Jerusalem use program #992? The Gefen mapping data would show this.

4. **NIF/Shatil connection:** No evidence of NIF funding was found, but the overlap in advocacy goals (reproductive rights, progressive education) and the use of PEF as fiscal sponsor (a common NIF-adjacent funding channel) warrants investigation.

5. **Forum 21 partners:** Which other organizations are in the Forum 21 coalition? This would map the full advocacy network.

6. **Board member backgrounds:** Dr. Shulamit Shulov-Barkan (chair) and Gusti Yehoshua Braverman appear to be notable figures. Their full backgrounds would illuminate the organization's governance orientation.

7. **Mobile Counseling Unit:** What content is delivered to homeless youth and sex workers? Who funds this operation?

8. **Arabic programming:** What specific content is delivered to Arab communities in East Jerusalem? Is it identical to the Hebrew curriculum or adapted?
