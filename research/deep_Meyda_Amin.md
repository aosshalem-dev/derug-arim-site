# Deep Research: מידע אמין על מין (Reliable Information About Sex)
## Operated by: Shlomit HaBaron (שלומית הברון)

**Research Date:** 2026-02-16
**Researcher:** Claude Opus 4.6 (deep research agent)
**Project:** דירוג ערים — Gender/Sexuality Education Cluster

## Executive Summary

**Thesis:** "Meyda Amin Al Min" (מידע אמין על מין) is NOT a solo practitioner operation — it is a well-organized commercial center with ~40 trained facilitators operating under the personal business registration (עוסק מורשה) of its founder Shlomit HaBaron. The entity has built a multi-channel operation (schools, counseling, training, publishing, podcasting) generating over NIS 1.18 million annually through the Gefen system alone, making it one of the largest individual-registered educational providers in the Ministry of Education catalog. HaBaron's prior activist work founding "Achat Mitoch Achat" (One Out of One) — an organization that collected 2,000+ sexual assault testimonies and maintained a database of 1,800 alleged perpetrators — positions her firmly within Israel's feminist activism network. Her transition from sexual violence activism to school-based sex education represents a significant pivot from advocacy to institutional access.

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH. The concern is not primarily ideological extremism but rather structural: a NIS 1.18M/year operation with 40 facilitators delivering content to children in 15 cities, registered as an individual business with no amuta transparency requirements. The content framework — promoting "healthy sexuality" from kindergarten through 12th grade, including LGBTQ+ affirmation, gender identity exploration, and normalization of masturbation for young children — falls within progressive Western sex education norms but significantly departs from traditional Israeli family values. Parents have limited visibility into classroom content.

## 2. Scale & Operations Model

### The Core Puzzle: How Does One Person Run 15 Cities?

**Answer: She doesn't operate alone.** The Gefen catalog lists this as "מידע אמין על מין (הברון שלומית)" — implying a sole proprietorship — but the operation employs approximately **40 healthy sexuality educators** (מחנכות ומחנכים למיניות בריאה).

### Entity Type
- **Legal registration:** עוסק מורשה (Authorized Dealer / Sole Proprietorship)
- **NOT a registered amuta** — no GuideStar page found, no public financial filings required
- **No company registration (חברה בע"מ)** detected

### Operational Scale (from Gefen data)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gefen Program Number | 2437 |
| Program Name | חינוך למיניות בריאה לילדים ונוער |
| Total Budget (Gefen) | NIS 1,189,256.67 |
| School Deployments | 136 (total school instances) |
| Unique Schools | ~51 (per city mapping) |
| Cities | 15 |
| Operator Type | עוסק מורשה |

### Geographic Footprint (15 cities)
1. גבעת שמואל (Givat Shmuel)
2. גבעתיים (Givatayim)
3. הוד השרון (Hod HaSharon)
4. הרצליה (Herzliya)
5. חיפה (Haifa)
6. ירושלים (Jerusalem)
7. כרמיאל (Karmiel)
8. קרית אונו (Kiryat Ono)
9. קרית גת (Kiryat Gat)
10. קרית שמונה (Kiryat Shmona)
11. רמת גן (Ramat Gan)
12. רמת השרון (Ramat HaSharon)
13. רעננה (Ra'anana)
14. ראש העין (Rosh Ha'Ayin)
15. תל אביב-יפו (Tel Aviv-Yafo)

**Geographic Analysis:** The spread covers the entire country from Kiryat Shmona (north) to Kiryat Gat (south), with heaviest concentration in the central Sharon/Gush Dan area. This geographic diversity is unusual for a sole proprietorship and is only possible because of the ~40 facilitator team.

### The Staffing Model
The facilitators have diverse professional backgrounds including:
- Social work
- Parent coaching/guidance
- Teaching
- School administration
- Educational counseling
- Group facilitation
- Youth at risk work

**Critical observation:** These ~40 people are likely classified as independent contractors (freelancers) rather than employees, which keeps the operation within the "עוסק מורשה" framework while running what is functionally a medium-sized organization. This has implications for:
1. **No amuta financial transparency** — no public filings required
2. **No board oversight** — no board of directors as would be required for an amuta
3. **Tax implications** — sole proprietor income vs. amuta nonprofit status
4. **Regulatory implications** — lighter regulation than a formal organization

### Revenue Channels
1. **Gefen (school programs):** NIS 1,189,257 (documented)
2. **"HaMatzpen" counseling center:** Paid phone/video consultations for parents
3. **Training courses/workshops:** Professional development for educators and therapists
4. **Lectures/events:** Via Eventer platform (shlomithevron)
5. **Book sales:** Modan Publishing (2019)
6. **Community center lectures:** e.g., Eilat community center, Mate Asher community center
7. **Podcast:** "Meyda Amin Al Min" podcast (monetization unclear)

**Total estimated revenue:** NIS 1.5-2.0M annually (Gefen alone is NIS 1.19M; add counseling, training, lectures, book royalties)

## 3. Programs & Content

### Ministry of Education Approved Program
- **Program Number:** 2437
- **Program Name:** חינוך למיניות בריאה לילדים ונוער (Healthy Sexuality Education for Children and Youth)
- **Field:** חברתי - ערכי (Social-Values)
- **Rating (project internal):** 5 (highest flag level)
- **Themes flagged:** gender, violence_prevention, sexuality, technology

### Target Age Groups
The program covers **kindergarten through 12th grade** using a "spiral" curriculum approach — repeating topics annually with increasing depth:

| Age Group | Grade Level | Key Topics |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Toddlers (3-5) | Preschool | Body parts naming, appropriate/inappropriate touch, "golden rules" of sexual safety |
| Young children (6-8) | Grades 1-2 | Where babies come from, good secrets vs bad secrets, body autonomy |
| Older children (8-11) | Grades 3-6 | "Traffic Light" (Ramzor) tool for appropriate/inappropriate behaviors, puberty, digital safety, pornography prevention |
| Early teens (12-14) | Grades 7-9 | Contraception, STI prevention, gender identity exploration, consent |
| Teens (15-18) | Grades 10-12 | Relationship skills, safer sex practices, media literacy, LGBTQ+ topics |

### School Program Format
- One-time lectures OR series of sessions/workshops
- **Gender-separated groups** (boys and girls separately)
- Parallel **parent lectures** to provide tools for home conversations
- Staff training for educational teams

### Content Philosophy (from published materials and articles)
Key positions expressed by HaBaron:

1. **"Sex education begins at home and is the full responsibility of parents"** — but schools must supplement because most parents don't provide adequate education
2. **Normalization of masturbation:** "Touching one's genitals is pleasant, healthy and private" — appropriate from ages 4-5, in private settings
3. **Anatomically correct naming:** Uses proper terms (e.g., "vulva"/פות) — podcast episode titled "Who's Afraid of the Word Vulva?"
4. **LGBTQ+ affirmation:** Curriculum includes "reducing homophobia and supporting LGBTQ+ youth" and "gender identity exploration"
5. **Anti-pornography but not sex-negative:** Pornography is framed as harmful exposure requiring prevention, but sexuality itself is framed positively
6. **Feminist framework:** "Open, professional and inclusive discourse on topics of sexuality, gender, identity and bodily rights"
7. **Evidence-based:** Claims to rely on research rather than abstinence-only ideology

### The "Traffic Light" (Ramzor) Tool
A behavioral assessment framework categorizing children's sexual behaviors as:
- **Green:** Normal/expected (e.g., curiosity about bodies)
- **Yellow:** Concerning/requires monitoring
- **Red:** Requires immediate intervention

Used from preschool through 12th grade with age-adapted criteria.

### Published Research
**Israel Adolescent Sexuality Survey 2015** (conducted by HaBaron):
- Sample: 739 Israeli youth (ages 18-19): 416 girls, 317 boys
- Sample skewed secular (72%) — under-representation of religious and Arab populations acknowledged
- Key findings:
  - 83% engage in some sexual contact by age 18
  - 78% of boys exposed to pornography by grade 7 (vs. 47% of girls)
  - Limited parent-child discussions persist despite youth openness
- Published in HebPsy with co-author Efrat Haron (Ph.D., bibliotherapist)

## 4. Ministry of Education Relationship

### Gefen Catalog Entry
- **Program 2437** is listed in the Gefen (גפ"ן) catalog, the Ministry of Education's approved vendor system for external educational programs
- Gefen programs can be purchased by schools and local authorities using their "flexible budget" (תקציב גמיש) allocation from the Ministry

### How Does an Individual Get Into Gefen?
The Gefen system accepts various entity types: associations (amutot), funds, authorized business persons (עוסק מורשה), exempt business persons (עוסק פטור), and companies (בע"מ). The approval process requires:
1. Completing an authorization request form
2. Obtaining username/password for the system
3. Submitting program details for review
4. Meeting Ministry content standards

**There is no requirement to be a registered nonprofit** — the system explicitly allows עוסק מורשה entities. This is a legitimate path, but it means the operation has less public accountability than amuta-registered programs.

### Ministry of Education Content Alignment
The Ministry of Education has a designated framework for "חינוך למיניות בריאה" (Healthy Sexuality Education) within its pedagogical guidelines. HaBaron's program appears to be aligned with the Ministry's stated framework, which:
- Emphasizes comprehensive sexuality education (not abstinence-only)
- Covers kindergarten through 12th grade
- Includes gender and identity topics
- Is approved for the "social-values" (חברתי-ערכי) field

### Recognition Level
- HaBaron is personally "recognized by the Ministry of Education" (מוכרות על ידי משרד החינוך) as a healthy sexuality educator
- This recognition preceded the Gefen program listing
- The exact approval mechanism and which Ministry officials championed the entry are **unknown** — this is an open question

## 5. Network Connections

### Israeli Association for Sex Education (SEI / האגודה לחינוך מיני)
- **Registration:** 580763738 (verified on GuideStar)
- **Role:** SEI functions as the professional umbrella/network for virtually all sex education practitioners in Israel
- **HaBaron's status:** Personally listed as a facilitator on SEI website
- **Meyda Amin Al Min's status:** Listed as member organization — "the Israeli Center for Sex Education"
- **SEI annual turnover:** Only NIS 265,740 (~$72K) — extremely small for an umbrella body (12.5% of sector median)
- **Government funding:** Zero documented government funding for SEI itself

### Network Map
HaBaron/Meyda Amin Al Min sits within a cluster of interconnected sex education providers:

| Connection | Nature | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| SEI (האגודה לחינוך מיני) | Listed as facilitator + org member | SEI website [verified] |
| מגע בתיאום (Touch in Coordination) | Both in Gefen catalog, both SEI members | Gefen data + SEI |
| חוש"ן (various sex ed orgs) | SEI network co-members | SEI member roster |
| נקודת מפגש (Nekudat Mifgash) | Shared network — connected individuals | Batch 3 research |
| מכון חרוב (Haruv Institute) | HaBaron presented at Haruv Institute | Haruv website [verified] |
| לבוא (LAVO) | Both in Gefen sex education cluster | Gefen data |
| תמורות | Both in gender/sexuality education cluster | Cluster analysis |
| Haaretz newspaper | Published author/columnist | Haaretz author page |
| "Achat Mitoch Achat" alumni | Former co-founder Gal Shargil | Multiple news sources |

### Haruv Institute Connection
HaBaron presented at the Haruv Institute (מכון חרוב — the Israeli National Institute for Child Welfare Research) on the topic: "Reliable Information About Sex: How to Talk with Children and Adolescents About Sex in the Age of Screens." This is a respectable academic institution focused on child welfare, and presenting there confers institutional legitimacy.

### Previous Organization: "Achat Mitoch Achat"
- **Founded:** October 2014 as Facebook initiative; registered as amuta April 2015
- **Co-founders:** Shlomit HaBaron + Gal Shargil
- **Activities:**
  - Collected 2,000+ sexual assault testimonies via Facebook
  - Built encrypted database of ~1,800 alleged perpetrators ("מאגר האנסים")
  - Cross-referenced perpetrator names to identify serial offenders
  - Helped expose the Alon Kastiel case
  - Facebook page had 37,000+ followers
- **Closed:** June 2019
- **Media coverage:** Calcalist, TheMarker, Ynet, Maariv, Mynet

**The activist-to-educator pipeline:** HaBaron's trajectory — from sexual violence activism (collecting assault testimonies, maintaining perpetrator databases) to school-based sex education for children — is significant. The worldview formed through processing 2,000+ assault testimonies inevitably shapes the lens through which sexuality is taught to young children. This is not inherently negative, but it means the educational approach is informed by a trauma-centered feminist perspective.

## 6. Financial Analysis

### Known Revenue
| Source | Amount (NIS) | Basis |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Gefen program deployments | 1,189,257 | Gefen database |
| Counseling center ("HaMatzpen") | Unknown | Paid phone consultations |
| Training courses | Unknown | Professional workshops |
| Lectures (Eventer, community centers) | Unknown | Per-event fees |
| Book royalties | Unknown | Modan Publishing |
| **Estimated Total** | **1,500,000 - 2,000,000** | Conservative estimate |

### Per-Unit Economics
- **Total Gefen budget:** NIS 1,189,257 across 136 school deployments and 51 unique schools
- **Average per school:** ~NIS 23,300 per school (total budget / 51 schools)
- **Average per deployment:** ~NIS 8,741 per deployment instance

### Financial Structure Concerns
1. **No public financial filings:** As a עוסק מורשה, HaBaron has no obligation to file public financial reports (unlike amutot which file with the Registrar of Amutot)
2. **No board oversight:** No board of directors reviews spending, program content, or facilitator qualifications
3. **Revenue scale vs. entity type:** NIS 1.19M through Gefen alone is substantial for a sole proprietorship — most עוסק מורשה entities in the education sector operate at a fraction of this scale
4. **Facilitator payments:** How ~40 facilitators are paid (employees? contractors? volunteers?) is unknown — this has significant labor law and tax implications
5. **No government transparency:** Unlike amutot visible on obudget.org, sole proprietorships receiving Gefen funds have minimal public accountability

### Government Funding Path
The money flows: **Ministry of Education → Local Authority/School → Gefen Purchase → Meyda Amin Al Min (HaBaron)**

This means the funding is technically school/municipal purchasing, not a direct government transfer to HaBaron. This is why the operation doesn't appear on obudget.org — the money is laundered through the school system's procurement process.

### Podcast Content (17 episodes as of Feb 2026)
Recent episode titles reveal the content orientation:

| Episode | Title (Hebrew) | Title (English) | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Latest | מי מפחד מהמילה פות? | Who's Afraid of the Word Vulva? | Normalization of anatomical terminology |
| Previous | בואו נדבר על אוננות | Let's Talk About Masturbation | Normalization of self-stimulation |
| Earlier | כשהילדים של ד' גונחים בכיתה | When Fourth Graders Make Moaning Sounds in Class | Classroom behavior management |
| Earlier | זהירות בתחבורה הציבורית | Safety in Public Transportation | Safety education |
| Earlier | בחורות ערומים זה כולירע | Naked Girls is Bad | Dress code discussion |
| #0 | What is sex education? | Introductory overview | Defines approach |

### Book Content
"מידע אמין על מין - איך לדבר עם ילדים ומתבגרים על מין בעידן המסכים" (2019, Modan Publishing)
- Co-authored with Sandy Bshartie Cordoba
- Listed in Yodaat (Knowledge Center on Women and Gender)
- Described as "the first time in Israel" providing parents with practical tools for sexual dialogue at home
- Content range: explaining how children come into the world through handling crises and uncooperative children/teens
- Available in print and digital formats

### Academic Article (HebPsy)
"Principles for Sex Education Programs for Youth in Israel"
- Co-authored with Efrat Haron (Ph.D., bibliotherapist)
- Based on 2015 survey of 739 Israeli youth
- Proposes K-12 "spiral" curriculum
- Values framework explicitly includes:
  - "Reducing homophobia and supporting LGBTQ+ youth"
  - "Gender-equitable communication about sexuality"
  - "Healthy sexuality grounded in evidence rather than abstinence-only ideology"
  - "Acknowledging cultural/religious differences while ensuring health outcomes"

### Media Appearances & Published Positions
1. **Ynet (Sex Appeal podcast):** "Sex education begins at home and is the full responsibility of parents" — positions herself as pro-parental involvement while arguing schools must supplement
2. **Yediot Aharonot (on Aya Na'afa case):** Condemns filming of sexual encounters; argues group sex at adolescence is "catastrophic"; emphasizes privacy and consent
3. **Ha-Makom investigative piece:** Wrote about inadequate psychiatric treatment for sexual assault survivors — shows continued activism lens
4. **TheMarker profile:** Described leaving Matrix (tech) career to fight sexual harassment full-time; quote: "I don't care if it's legal or illegal. It's disgusting, it's threatening"

### Content Assessment
The content is **professional and broadly aligned with Western progressive sex education standards** (similar to SIECUS guidelines in the US or UNESCO comprehensive sexuality education framework). Key characteristics:

**Potentially concerning elements (from a traditional values perspective):**
- Teaching children as young as 4-5 that touching genitals is "pleasant, healthy and private"
- LGBTQ+ affirmation and gender identity exploration for minors
- Feminist framework embedded throughout
- Anti-abstinence-only position
- Progressive values framing that may conflict with religious family values

**Mitigating factors:**
- Focus on sexual safety and prevention of abuse (legitimate educational goal)
- Gender-separated groups in schools
- Parallel parent lectures (providing some transparency)
- Emphasis on consent and boundaries
- Based on published research (even if limited sample)
- Book and podcast give parents access to the same content

---

## 8. Parental Awareness

### What Parents See
1. **Parent lectures:** The program includes parallel parent sessions — parents are offered lectures on puberty, digital sexuality, pornography, consent, LGBTQ+ topics
2. **Book:** Parents can purchase and read the full content framework
3. **Podcast:** 17 publicly available episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify
4. **Website:** minamin.org has content pages for each age group (though Wix rendering makes them hard to scrape)
5. **Instagram:** @israel_center_sex_education — 14K followers, 427 posts

### What Parents May NOT See
1. **Actual classroom content:** The specific materials, activities, and discussions used with their children in school
2. **Facilitator qualifications:** Which of the ~40 facilitators is actually delivering content to their child, and what training that specific person has
3. **The activist background:** HaBaron's prior work with "Achat Mitoch Achat" and the "rapist database" is publicly known but may not be communicated to parents when the school purchases the program
4. **The financial structure:** That this is a sole proprietorship with no nonprofit transparency requirements
5. **Opt-out options:** Whether parents can opt their children out of specific sessions is unclear

### Communication Channels
- **Eventer platform:** Events and workshops listed publicly (shlomithevron)
- **SOS telephone service:** Paid phone consultations available
- **Newsletter/mailing list:** Claims 50,000+ subscribers (unverified)

---

## 9. Controversies

### Direct Controversies
**No major public controversies found** specifically targeting "Meyda Amin Al Min" or its school programs. The absence of controversy may reflect:
- The program operating within Ministry of Education approval
- Parent lectures providing some cover
- The general Israeli media environment being more permissive of progressive sex education than comparable US contexts

### Related Controversy: "Achat Mitoch Achat"
HaBaron's previous organization was more controversial:
- **The "Rapist Database":** Maintaining an encrypted database of 1,800 alleged perpetrators raised serious due process and privacy concerns
- **Closure in 2019:** The organization shut down after 4 years — reasons for closure not publicly documented
- **Legal exposure:** Cross-referencing alleged perpetrator names without legal proceedings creates defamation risk

### Broader Context: Sex Education Controversies in Israel
- **2013:** Israel removed sex education from junior high curriculum under ultra-Orthodox political pressure (Deseret News)
- **2021:** Haaretz editorial "Israel Needs Sex Ed in Schools. Now" — reflecting ongoing cultural battle
- **Orthodox resistance:** Haaretz reported on an Orthodox NGO teaching Jerusalem students sex-ed "in the spirit of Judaism" — indicating competing approaches
- **Religious school resistance:** Multiple reports of Israeli religious schools refusing or minimizing sex education (Jerusalem Post, others)

## 10. Values Alignment Table

| Value | Alignment | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Parental Authority | PARTIAL | Claims parents have primary responsibility, but program brings feminist framework into schools without full parental visibility into classroom content |
| Jewish/Traditional Values | LOW | Feminist and LGBTQ+-affirming framework; normalizes behaviors traditional communities consider problematic; no religious dimension to content |
| Child Protection | HIGH | Anti-abuse, anti-exploitation focus; "golden rules" of sexual safety; trauma-informed approach |
| Academic Rigor | MEDIUM | Published research with acknowledged sample limitations; evidence-based claims but limited peer review |
| Transparency | LOW-MEDIUM | Book and podcast are public, but school classroom content, facilitator quals, and financials are opaque |
| Age Appropriateness | CONTESTED | Teaching that genital touching is "pleasant" to 4-5 year olds is mainstream in progressive sex ed but deeply controversial in traditional communities |
| Gender Ideology | HIGH PROGRESSIVE | Explicit LGBTQ+ affirmation, gender identity exploration for minors, feminist framework throughout |
| Financial Accountability | LOW | Sole proprietorship with NIS 1.19M+ in government-funded school contracts, zero public financial filings |
| Professional Standards | MEDIUM-HIGH | 40 trained facilitators, published materials, Haruv Institute connection; but facilitator qualifications vary and certification is self-awarded |

---

## 11. Open Questions

1. **Who are the 40 facilitators?** Names, qualifications, criminal background checks? Are they employees or independent contractors? How are they trained and supervised?

2. **Exact classroom curriculum:** What specific activities and materials are used with children in grades 3-6? Is there a standardized curriculum or does each facilitator improvise?

3. **Why עוסק מורשה instead of amuta?** At NIS 1.19M revenue, the choice to remain a sole proprietorship rather than register as an amuta appears deliberate — avoiding transparency requirements. Was this ever questioned by the Ministry?

4. **Who approved Program 2437?** Which Ministry of Education officials reviewed and approved this program for the Gefen catalog? What review criteria were applied?

5. **Sandy Bshartie Cordoba's current role:** Is she still active co-director? Her background is less documented than HaBaron's.

6. **Revenue from non-Gefen channels:** How much additional revenue comes from counseling, training, lectures, and books?

7. **Content alignment with parental values:** In cities like Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Shmona, and Jerusalem (which have significant traditional/religious populations), are parents fully aware of the LGBTQ+ and gender identity content?

8. **Facilitator compensation structure:** If 40 facilitators serve 51 schools generating NIS 1.19M, what is the facilitator take-home vs. HaBaron's cut?

9. **"Achat Mitoch Achat" closure reasons:** Why did the organization that collected 2,000+ assault testimonies shut down in 2019? Was there legal pressure?

10. **Competition or monopoly?** Is "Meyda Amin Al Min" the only sex education provider in these 15 cities, or do schools have alternative options?
