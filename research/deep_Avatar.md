**Budget:** NIS 188,430 across 6 cities

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / THESIS

**Wonderkids Avatar Ltd. is a legitimate Israeli enrichment company running an imaginative play-based program for children in elementary schools. However, the company's deliberate choice of the name "Avatar" — identical to a globally notorious consciousness-manipulation course founded by an ex-Scientologist and classified as a cult/sect by multiple European governments — raises serious questions about whether this is naivety, coincidence, or deliberate brand laundering. No direct organizational link to Harry Palmer's Stars Edge International has been proven, but the parallels in language ("between imagination and reality," belief management, self-confidence through imagination exercises) and the documented pattern of the Avatar Course infiltrating schools in the Netherlands warrant heightened scrutiny.**

The per-school budget (~NIS 31,405/school for 6 schools) is high for an enrichment program. The company is a private limited company (not an amuta), which means zero public transparency on finances. Its sole documented government income (NIS 43,000) comes from a "circus arts" contract — not from an "Avatar" program — suggesting the bulk of funding comes from municipal Gefen budgets or direct school purchases, with no centralized oversight.

## 1. COMPANY REGISTRATION & LEGAL STRUCTURE

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Hebrew Name** | ילדי הפלא אווטאר בע"מ |
| **English Name** | WONDERKIDS AVATAR LTD |
| **Registration Number** | 515937837 |
| **Company Type** | Private Limited Company (חברה פרטית) |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Founded** | December 11, 2018 |
| **Registered Address** | HaDekalim 127, Pardes Hanna-Karkur |
| **Stated Purpose** | "To engage in any lawful business" (generic) |
| **Contact Person (obudget)** | Tal Nadler |

### Key Legal Structure Notes:
- **Private company, NOT an amuta (nonprofit).** This is significant. As a בע"מ, the company has NO obligation to publish financial statements, board composition, or donor lists. There is no GuideStar Israel page for this entity because GuideStar covers amutot and public benefit companies, not private companies.
- **No shareholders or directors publicly available** through web sources. The Israeli Companies Registrar (Rasham HaChavrot) would have this data, but it is not freely searchable online in full detail.
- **Founded December 2018**, but Wonder Kids (as a brand/project) has operated since late 2010 according to the founder. This suggests the company was incorporated years after the project began — possibly to formalize or separate the Avatar brand.

### Related Companies:
- **אווטאר פיתוח בע"מ** (Avatar Development Ltd., registration 513914184) — a separate company that appears on obudget.org. NOT confirmed to be related to Wonderkids. This appears to be a different entity.
- **הומי אווטאר בע"מ** (Homy Avatar Ltd., registration 516169463) — another separate entity. No confirmed link.

## 2. THE PROGRAM: "AVATAR — BETWEEN IMAGINATION AND REALITY"

### What the Company Says:
The Avatar program is described as Wonderkids' **flagship offering** — an "interactive educational workshop" where:
- Children "enter an imaginary adventure" and are "tasked with saving the world"
- They encounter "wonderful/magical creatures"
- They solve challenges, conduct experiments, "learn magic"
- They are exposed to and work through personal and social content including: **self-acceptance, self-confidence, social relationships, teamwork, mutual respect, responsibility-taking, and decision-making**

### Target Age:
- Grades 1-2 (ages 6-8) primarily
- Delivered in groups of approximately 15-20 children
- Year-long curriculum with weekly sessions

### Methodology:
According to TheMarker (Jan 2024) profile of founder Tal Nadler:
- The method "leverages children's imagination as the primary resource"
- Instructors narrate scenarios that incorporate activities, games, and various experiential elements
- Example: Students on an "imaginary frozen planet" learned that making mistakes isn't catastrophic — they participated in "intentionally bad singing competitions" to overcome stage fright
- The approach combines "gameplay with personal/social development themes"

### What Children Actually Experience:
Based on available descriptions, the Avatar sessions involve:
1. A narrative frame (imaginary world, quest, mission)
2. Physical activities and games tied to the narrative
3. "Experiments" (nature unclear — could be science demos or psychological exercises)
4. "Magic" learning (likely stage magic/illusions)
5. Guided discussions about feelings, self-perception, and social dynamics
6. Group challenges requiring cooperation

### The Name "Between Imagination and Reality":
This subtitle is the most concerning element. In the context of Harry Palmer's Avatar Course (see Section 7), "the space between imagination and reality" is a core philosophical concept — the idea that beliefs shape reality and that by managing one's beliefs/imagination, one can alter one's experienced reality. While the children's program may use this phrase innocuously (children exploring the boundary between fantasy play and real life), the terminological overlap is striking.

## 3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Known Government Funding:
| Source | Amount | Year | Program |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Administration for Youth Absorption & Informal Education | NIS 43,000 | 2023 | Program 14003: "Circus/Circus Arts" |
| **Total documented government transfers** | **NIS 43,000** | | |

### Budget Analysis (NIS 188,430 for 6 cities):
- **Per-city average:** NIS 31,405
- **Per-school average** (assuming 1 school/city): NIS 31,405
- **Per-session estimate** (assuming ~30 weekly sessions/year): ~NIS 1,047/session
- **Per-child estimate** (assuming 20 children/group, 1 group/school): ~NIS 1,570/child/year

**Assessment:** NIS 31,405 per school is **moderate-to-high** for an enrichment program. Standard Gefen-funded programs run NIS 15,000-25,000 per school. However, if the program involves multiple groups per school or specialized materials/equipment, the cost could be justified. The company's documentation of only NIS 43,000 in government transfers (and that for "circus" — not "Avatar") means the NIS 188,430 likely comes from:
- Municipal Gefen budgets (school-level purchasing)
- Direct school budgets
- Parent contributions (unlikely for in-school programs)

### Financial Opacity:
As a private company (בע"מ), Wonderkids Avatar Ltd. publishes **zero financial information publicly**. There are:
- No annual reports
- No donor disclosures
- No board composition data
- No salary information
- No information on whether Tal Nadler or other shareholders extract profits

This is the single biggest red flag from a governance perspective. An enrichment program operating in public schools using public funds should arguably operate as an amuta with full transparency, not as a private company.

## 4. LEADERSHIP

### Tal Nadler — Founder & CEO
- **Role:** Founder of Wonderkids (2010), CEO of Wonderkids Avatar Ltd. (2018)
- **Background:** Describes himself as "educator, social entrepreneur, and artist" with backgrounds in "psychology, neuroscience, and music"
- **Personal story:** Says he struggled with attention difficulties in school — teachers "lacked tools to address" this — and created Wonderkids as "a correction to his own educational experience"
- **Self-description:** "A child at heart"
- **Education:** Claimed backgrounds in psychology and neuroscience, but no specific degrees or institutions named in any public source
- **Other affiliations:** None found in public sources
- **LinkedIn:** Company page exists ("ילדי הפלא") but no personal LinkedIn profile found for Tal Nadler associated with this company

### Key Team Members (from website and articles):
- **Nicky Libshitz** — Marketing manager; leads "Field and Net" (digital safety) program
- **Assi Swissa** — Avatar instructor, teaches 6 groups in grades 1-2
- **Rachel** — Senior Avatar instructor (first name only in testimonials)
- **Gai Lanman** — Comics instructor (described as "award-winning")
- **~150 total instructors** across all programs (claimed)
- **7 core office staff** ("people with purpose")

### Assessment:
Tal Nadler's background claims ("psychology, neuroscience") are unverifiable. No academic publications, no institutional affiliations, no professional licenses found in public records. This is not necessarily disqualifying — many education entrepreneurs lack formal academic credentials — but it contrasts with the clinical/psychological language used to describe the Avatar program's methodology. The team includes "psychotherapists" but none are named publicly.

## 5. PROGRAM CONTENT ANALYSIS

### What Is Explicitly Stated:
The Avatar program addresses standard social-emotional learning (SEL) themes:
- Self-acceptance and confidence
- Social relationships and teamwork
- Mutual respect
- Responsibility and decision-making
- Emotional regulation
- Coping with fears and stage fright

### What Is NOT Stated But Can Be Inferred:
The program description uses specific language patterns:
- **"Between imagination and reality"** — implies exercises that blur or explore the boundary between mental constructs and external reality
- **"Experiments"** — in an imagination-based program, this could mean psychological exercises rather than science experiments
- **"Magic"** — could be stage magic, or could involve "belief in possibilities" framing
- **"Entering an adventure"** — guided visualization/imagination exercises
- **"Personal content"** — individual psychological work with 6-8 year olds

### Content Risk Assessment:
| Factor | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Gender identity content | **Not detected** | No mention in any source |
| Social justice ideology | **Low** | "The Most Israeli" program promotes "equality and understanding" among ethnic groups — mild multicultural content |
| Religious/spiritual content | **Unclear** | No explicit mention, but "imagination shapes reality" framework overlaps with New Age thought |
| Psychological manipulation | **Medium** | Guided imagination exercises with young children raise questions about age-appropriateness of belief-modification techniques |
| New Age / consciousness content | **Medium-High** | See Section 7 below |

### Missing Information (Critical Gaps):
- **No published curriculum** — the actual session plans, facilitator guides, and training materials are not publicly available
- **No independent evaluation** — no academic study, MoE review, or third-party assessment of outcomes
- **No parental consent documentation** — unclear what parents are told about program content
- **No opt-out mechanism** documented

---

## 6. GOVERNMENT APPROVAL — HOW DID IT ENTER THE GEFEN CATALOG?

### Gefen System Overview:
The Gefen system (גמישות פדגוגית ניהולית) allows schools to select enrichment programs from a catalog of approved providers. Approval requires:
1. Registration as an approved supplier
2. Program description submission
3. Meeting basic safety and insurance requirements
4. **No rigorous content review** — this is a known weakness of the system

### Wonderkids in Gefen:
- The program was **not found** in a direct search of the mygefen.co.il catalog (as of this research date)
- This could mean: (a) the program uses a different catalog name, (b) it is purchased directly by schools outside Gefen, (c) it is bundled under a general "enrichment" category, or (d) it operates through municipal contracts rather than the national Gefen catalog
- The company's obudget record shows only a "circus arts" contract — suggesting the company may list different programs under different categories

### MoE Approval Status:
- **No evidence found** of specific Ministry of Education approval for the "Avatar" program content
- **No evidence found** of the program appearing in the MoE's official educational programs portal (apps.education.gov.il/tyhnet)
- The company may operate entirely through local municipal purchasing, bypassing national-level content review

## 7. THE AVATAR COURSE CONNECTION — CRITICAL ANALYSIS

### Harry Palmer's Avatar Course: Background

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Founded** | 1986, by Harry Palmer |
| **Company** | Star's Edge International, Inc. (Altamonte Springs, Florida) |
| **Palmer's background** | Ex-Scientology mission operator (15 years); B.A. English (Ithaca College, 1969); M.Ed. (Elmira College, 1971) |
| **Classification** | LGAT (Large Group Awareness Training); classified as cult/sect by multiple sources |
| **Presence** | 100,000+ participants, 150+ countries, materials in 30+ languages |
| **Cost** | Basic course: $2,395; advanced levels up to $7,500+ |
| **Israel presence** | avatar9.co.il operated by Miri Sharon; Hebrew-language materials available |
| **Core concept** | "Belief management" — the idea that beliefs create one's experienced reality, and by managing/changing beliefs, one changes reality |

### Cult/Sect Classifications:
- **ICSA (International Cultic Studies Association):** Published critical analysis
- **Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religious Movements:** Listed as entry "Avatar (1986)"
- **Sektesignaal (Netherlands):** Justice ministry monitoring organization flagged Avatar; requested education minister investigation
- **BITE Model analysis:** Applied by avataruncovered.is (ex-member advocacy site)
- **European media:** Routinely described as "Scientology-Lite"

### The Dutch Schools Scandal (2018):
In March 2018, Dutch newspaper NRC and current affairs show De Monitor revealed:
- **Avatar had infiltrated up to 6 private schools** in the Netherlands
- Schools included the **Guus Kieft School** (Amstelveen) and **De Ruimte** (Soest)
- Schools were "democratic schools" taking in children who failed in the regular system
- Management boards were **staffed with Avatar members** (six at De Ruimte)
- Parents were **encouraged to take Avatar training courses**
- **Local councillors with "Wizard" status** promoted Avatar by sending civil servants on courses
- Avatar members **advocated exorcism to cure cancer and ADHD** in children
- One mother withdrew her children, stating: "Our experience is that Avatar brainwashing is very evident there"
- **~1,600 Avatar trainers** operated in the Netherlands
- The Dutch justice ministry's Sektesignaal monitoring organization asked the education minister to investigate

### Ex-Member Reports:
The avataruncovered.is website and ICSA articles document:
- Financial ruin
- Psychological abuse
- Hospitalizations
- Family breakdown
- Suicidal ideation
- "Mind control, hypnotic exercises, confessional elements" in training
- The Wizards Course incorporates Scientology's "Wall of Fire" narrative

### The Connection Question: Is Wonderkids Avatar connected to Stars Edge?

**Evidence FOR a connection:**
1. **The name "Avatar"** — choosing this specific name for a children's imagination/belief program is remarkable given the globally known Avatar Course
2. **"Between imagination and reality"** — a core Avatar Course concept is that imagination/beliefs shape experienced reality
3. **Focus on "self-confidence through imagination"** — mirrors Avatar Course's "belief management"
4. **Pardes Hanna-Karkur location** — a town known for its alternative/New Age community concentration in Israel
5. **The company was incorporated in 2018** — the same year as the Dutch schools scandal. Could this represent a deliberate rebranding/distancing strategy?
6. **avatar9.co.il exists** — Harry Palmer's Avatar Course is actively marketed in Israel in Hebrew
7. **No transparency** on founder's training/background — "psychology and neuroscience" claims are unverifiable

**Evidence AGAINST a connection:**
1. **The program content as described** appears to be standard SEL (social-emotional learning) delivered through imaginative play — not consciousness training
2. **"Avatar" is a common word** in Hebrew pop culture (the animated series, the James Cameron films)
3. **The program also includes "magic tricks" and "experiments"** — suggesting a children's entertainment approach rather than psychological techniques
4. **No direct mention** of Harry Palmer, Stars Edge, "belief management," or consciousness exploration on the Wonderkids website
5. **The company offers 50+ programs** — Avatar is one of many, not an exclusive focus
6. **Tal Nadler is positioned as an educator/entrepreneur**, not as a spiritual teacher or Avatar Master

**Assessment:**
**The connection cannot be confirmed, but the overlap is concerning enough to warrant investigation.** At minimum, the choice of the name "Avatar" for a children's program dealing with imagination, beliefs, and self-perception — in a country where the Avatar Course is actively marketed — demonstrates either:
- (a) Ignorance of the association (negligent)
- (b) Deliberate choice knowing the association (alarming)
- (c) An actual operational connection (most alarming)

The Dutch precedent demonstrates that Avatar Course adherents **have historically infiltrated school systems** through indirect means — not by advertising the Avatar Course directly, but by establishing educational programs that incorporate Avatar principles under different names.

## 8. CONTROVERSIES & PARENTAL FEEDBACK

### Public Complaints:
- **None found** in Israeli media, forums, or complaint databases
- No consumer protection complaints
- No Education Ministry warnings

### Testimonials (from company website):
- All positive (naturally — these are curated)
- Schools mentioned: Sharet School (Kiryat Ono), Pesgot School, others
- Parents and school staff praise "professionalism" and "engaging content"

### Media Coverage:
- **TheMarker (Jan 2024):** Positive profile of Tal Nadler as innovative educator — no critical questions asked about the Avatar name or methodology
- **No investigative journalism** found about the company

### The Absence of Criticism:
The total absence of critical coverage is neither reassuring nor alarming on its own — small enrichment companies often fly below the media radar. However, for a company operating in 100+ schools for 15 years, the lack of ANY independent evaluation (positive or negative) is notable.

---

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

1. **Who are the shareholders and directors** of ילדי הפלא אווטאר בע"מ (515937837)? A Companies Registrar extract (נסח חברה) would reveal this — costs ~NIS 20-40.

2. **Has Tal Nadler ever taken the Avatar Course** (Harry Palmer's version)? Is he a licensed Avatar Master? Is he on the Stars Edge master directory?

3. **What training do the Avatar instructors receive?** Are they trained internally by Wonderkids, or do they receive training from external sources?

4. **What are the actual session plans?** Parents should request and review the full curriculum before consenting to their children's participation.

5. **How exactly did the program enter the municipal purchasing systems** in 6 cities? Who approved it? Was a content review conducted?

6. **Who pays the NIS 188,430?** Is this from Gefen budgets, municipal discretionary funds, school budgets, or a combination?

7. **Is there any corporate or personal relationship** between Wonderkids personnel and avatar9.co.il (Israeli Avatar Course) personnel?

8. **Why was the company incorporated in December 2018** — the same year as the Dutch Avatar schools scandal?

9. **What does "experiments" mean** in the context of the Avatar sessions? Are these science experiments or psychological exercises?

10. **Is Pardes Hanna-Karkur's alternative community** (known concentration of New Age practitioners) relevant to the company's location choice?

---

## 11. RISK SUMMARY

### Risk Factors:
- **Private company operating in public schools** with zero financial transparency
- **Name identical** to a globally documented consciousness-manipulation cult's core program
- **Methodology language** ("between imagination and reality," belief-based self-confidence) overlaps with Avatar Course terminology
- **No published curriculum**, no independent evaluation, no verifiable academic grounding
- **Founder's credentials** ("psychology, neuroscience") unverifiable
- **Historical precedent:** Avatar Course adherents infiltrated 6 schools in the Netherlands (2018)
- **Active Avatar Course presence in Israel** (avatar9.co.il) creates possibility of cross-pollination
- **High per-school cost** relative to standard enrichment programs
- **Government contract documented as "circus"** — not "Avatar" — suggesting possible category mismatch

### Mitigating Factors:
- Program content as publicly described appears to be standard SEL through imaginative play
- Company has operated for 15 years with no documented complaints
- 100+ schools served with positive testimonials
- 50+ programs offered — Avatar is one component, not the sole focus
- "Avatar" is a widely used word in Israeli pop culture (animated series, films)
- No smoking gun connecting Wonderkids to Stars Edge International

### Bottom Line:
**The program deserves investigation, not condemnation, based on current evidence.** The most important next step is obtaining the Companies Registrar extract to identify shareholders/directors, and requesting the actual curriculum documents from the company. Parents of children in the program should ask specific questions about:
- What exercises their children are doing
- What "experiments" involve
- Whether any visualization/guided imagination exercises are used
- What training the instructors have received and from whom

If the program is genuinely just creative play with SEL themes, the name is an unfortunate coincidence. If investigation reveals connections to the Avatar Course network, this would be a serious child safety concern with national implications.
