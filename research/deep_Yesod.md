## Executive Summary / Thesis

Yesod is a small but well-connected Israeli NGO operating in the civic education space, founded in 2012 and funded primarily by tech billionaire Moshe Yanai. The organization operates two programs in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog and claims to have reached 76,000 students in 250 schools across 22 local authorities. Its steering committee reads like a who's-who of Israel's liberal-legal establishment: a former Deputy PM, a former Supreme Court justice, a former UN ambassador, and a leading constitutional law scholar.

The critical finding is the **financial sustainability risk**: Yesod's sole known major funder, Moshe Yanai, was declared bankrupt in October 2025 with debts exceeding $120 million. The organization's annual revenue is approximately NIS 1.78M (2024), entirely from non-government sources -- no documented government transfers exist. This suggests near-total dependence on Yanai's philanthropy, which is now in jeopardy.

Ideologically, Yesod positions itself as promoting the "foundational values of the Declaration of Independence" -- democratic, egalitarian, rights-based. It is not explicitly post-Zionist; its framing centers on Israel as "a Jewish and democratic state." However, its steering committee members are overwhelmingly associated with the liberal-centrist camp, and its emphasis on judicial independence, basic rights legislation, and "active citizenship" aligns with the anti-judicial-overhaul movement. The organization commissioned a high-profile survey in December 2022 showing 60% of Israelis feared for democracy -- released during the height of the judicial reform crisis.

No evidence was found of NIF, EU, or foreign government funding. No US 501(c)(3) entity was identified. NGO Monitor does not appear to have profiled Yesod. This is a relatively low-profile, domestically funded operation compared to organizations like ACRI or IDI.

## 2. Financial Analysis

### Revenue

| Year | Revenue (NIS) | Sector Median |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024 | 1,778,412 | 2,119,903 |

**Source:** https://next.obudget.org/i/org/association/580558997

### Government Funding

**Zero.** The obudget.org page explicitly states: "לא תועדו הכנסות של הארגון מכספי המדינה בשלוש השנים האחרונות" -- no government income was documented in the last three years.

This is notable for an organization operating two programs in the Ministry of Education's Gefen catalog. Gefen programs are typically funded by the schools/municipalities purchasing them using their Gefen budget allocation -- the money flows from MoE to school to provider, rather than appearing as a direct government transfer. This may explain the zero figure on obudget.org while the organization still receives indirect government money.

### Staffing (2024)
- **Employees:** 5
- **Volunteers:** 4

This is a very lean operation for an org claiming 76,000 student reach. The low employee count suggests heavy reliance on external facilitators or contracted educators.

### Primary Funding Source: Moshe Yanai

The Wikipedia article and multiple sources confirm Yesod was founded "with funding from high-tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Moshe Yanai" (במימון יזם ההייטק והנדבן משה ינאי). No other major funders have been identified in any public source.

### CRITICAL: Yanai's Bankruptcy (October 2025)

Moshe Yanai was declared bankrupt by Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court in October 2025:

- **Total debts:** Over $120 million
- **Primary debt:** $42M to Scintilla fund (Cayman Islands)
- **Additional debts:** $7.5M to Tauman family; various other creditors
- **Restrictions imposed:** Travel ban, limited banking, no corporate directorships
- **Infinidat sale:** Lenovo acquired Infinidat (Jan 2025), but Yanai's personal proceeds estimated at only $3.5M
- **Between 2007-2023:** Yanai reported cumulative personal income of NIS 790M (~NIS 46M/year avg)

**Implication for Yesod:** If Yanai was the primary/sole funder, Yesod faces an existential financial threat. With NIS 1.78M annual revenue and no government transfers, the organization's future depends on finding alternative funding sources.

### Foreign Funding

**No evidence found** of funding from:
- New Israel Fund (NIF) -- not listed in NIF grantee databases
- European Union
- US foundations
- Any foreign government

**No US 501(c)(3) entity identified** ("American Friends of Yesod" or similar). Search of IRS databases and ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer returned no results.

This is unusual for an Israeli human rights-adjacent NGO. The absence of foreign funding, if accurate, suggests this is genuinely a single-donor philanthropic venture.

1. **Personal and civic responsibility** among children and youth
2. **Knowledge and tools** in fundamental rights, democratic values, Israeli law, the justice system, argumentation and persuasion
3. **Critical thinking** and dialogue skills
4. **Active citizenship** (activism education)

### Core Educational Principle

"The State of Israel was founded as a democratic and Jewish state, ensuring social and equal civil and social rights for all its citizens, regardless of religion, race, or gender" -- language directly from the Declaration of Independence.

### Specific Programs and Activities

1. **Children's Parliament (פרלמנט ילדים):** Municipal-level youth parliaments. In Herzliya, called "M.A.Z." (מ.ע.ז -- Leadership, Values and Children's Rights). Involves ~120 representatives from grades 5-6 across all elementary schools. Operates through three municipal committees: urban, environment, and education. Run in partnership with Herzliya municipality and the Ministry of Education's national inspectorate for student rights.

## 5. Ideology and Framing

### How Yesod Defines "Basic Rights"

Yesod's framework centers on:
- Rights enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence (equality regardless of religion, race, gender)
- The Basic Laws (particularly Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty)
- Democratic values: rule of law, separation of powers, judicial independence, minority rights
- Active citizenship and civic responsibility

### Is Yesod Post-Zionist?

**No explicit post-Zionist framing was found.** The organization:
- Refers to Israel as "a Jewish and democratic state"
- Grounds its curriculum in the Declaration of Independence
- Does not appear to address the Palestinian conflict, settlements, or occupation in its educational materials
- Focuses exclusively on internal Israeli democratic culture and citizen rights

However, the **practical emphasis** is overwhelmingly on the "democratic" side of the "Jewish and democratic" equation. The curriculum emphasizes rights, equality, rule of law, and pluralism -- not Jewish national identity, Zionist narrative, or Jewish peoplehood. This is a common pattern in Israeli liberal civic education organizations.

### Hebrew vs. English Messaging Gaps

The English website (yesod.ngo/en/) and Hebrew website (yesod.ngo/) are largely aligned. Both use the same core framing:
- Democracy education through the Declaration of Independence
- Empowering youth with civic tools
- Policy advancement for basic rights

**No significant messaging gap** was detected. The English site is a relatively faithful translation of the Hebrew content. This is unlike more politically charged organizations (e.g., B'Tselem) where Hebrew and English messaging can diverge significantly.

### Semantic Displacement Analysis

Yesod does not appear to redefine standard terms. "Democracy," "basic rights," and "civic education" are used in their conventional Israeli-liberal meaning. The organization does not push a radical redefinition of Zionism or Jewish identity.

### The Survey and Timing

In December 2022, Yesod commissioned a survey (conducted by Geocartography) of 621 university graduates and 202 youth (ages 16-18):
- 60% of the Israeli public feared "the future of democracy in the Jewish state is at risk"
- 94% agreed democracy is important
- 75% believed schools inadequately teach democracy
- Sharp secular/religious divide on judicial authority

This survey was released during the peak of the judicial reform crisis (January 2023), positioning Yesod's mission as urgently relevant. The timing and findings align with the anti-judicial-overhaul movement.

## 6. Foreign Funding

### New Israel Fund (NIF)

**No evidence found.** Yesod does not appear in NIF's grantee listings or magen grant recipients.

### European Union

**No evidence found** of EU funding.

### US Foundations

**No evidence found** of US foundation funding. No 501(c)(3) "American Friends" entity identified.

### Other Foreign Sources

**No evidence found** of any foreign government or foundation funding.

### Assessment

If this finding is accurate, Yesod is unusual among Israeli human-rights-adjacent NGOs in being entirely domestically funded. This may be a deliberate strategy to avoid the political toxicity of foreign funding in Israeli discourse (the "Foreign Agents Law" controversy). It may also simply reflect that the organization was a single-donor personal philanthropy project of Moshe Yanai.

---

## 7. Controversies and Media Coverage

### Minimal Controversy Profile

Yesod has a notably **low controversy profile** compared to other Israeli democracy/rights organizations:

- **Not profiled by NGO Monitor** (the primary watchdog of Israeli left-wing NGOs)
- **No Knesset investigation** or debate found targeting the organization
- **No negative media coverage** found in Israel Hayom, Maariv, or other right-wing media
- **No BDS connections** or anti-Israel allegations

### Possible Reasons for Low Profile

1. **No foreign funding** = no "foreign agent" angle for critics
2. **Small scale** = below the radar of watchdog organizations
3. **Education focus** = less politically provocative than litigation (ACRI) or occupation documentation (B'Tselem)
4. **Establishment figures** on steering committee = Dan Meridor (former Likud minister) provides right-of-center credibility
5. **Declaration of Independence framing** = positions the org within mainstream Zionist consensus rather than anti-Zionist discourse

### Ministry of Education Context

In September 2025, Israeli media reported that the Ministry of Education under the current government was removing chapters on liberal democracy from the civics matriculation exam and boosting nationalist content. This provides context for Yesod's work: the organization operates in a contested educational space where the definition of "democracy" and the scope of civic education are politically charged.

## 8. Network and Connections

### Direct Organizational Partnerships

| Partner | Nature of Relationship |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Ministry of Education** | Gefen catalog provider; operates within formal education framework |
| **Reichman University / Rubinstein Center for Constitutional Challenges** | Annual conference co-host; Yaniv Roznai (steering committee) is faculty there |
| **Municipal authorities** (e.g., Herzliya) | Children's Parliament programs; city-wide civic initiatives |
| **MoE National Inspectorate for Student Rights** | Partner on Herzliya Children's Parliament |

### Steering Committee Cross-Memberships

| Person | Other Organizations |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Gabriela Shalev** | IDI (Israel Democracy Institute) board; Bank Hapoalim board; Hadassah Medical |
| **Dan Meridor** | Israel Council on Foreign Relations (President); World Jewish Congress affiliations |
| **Colette Avital** | Socialist International (VP); Yad Vashem activities; labor movement |
| **Yaniv Roznai** | Reichman University faculty; extensive academic publications |
| **Salim Joubran** | Hebrew University alumni network (deceased 2024) |

### Connection to Other Human Rights Orgs

**No direct institutional connections found** to:
- ACRI (Association for Civil Rights in Israel)
- B'Tselem
- Adalah
- Shalom Achshav (Peace Now)
- Breaking the Silence
- Yesh Din

Yesod operates in a distinct niche -- **education, not litigation or documentation**. It does not appear to be part of the "human rights coalition" that includes ACRI, B'Tselem, Adalah, etc. Its steering committee members may have personal connections to these organizations (e.g., Gabriela Shalev's IDI board service, Dan Meridor's liberal advocacy), but the org itself maintains separation.

### Connection to Mishmar HaChinuch HaMemlachti

Yesod's programs appear in the Mishmar HaChinuch (State Education Guard) database of Gefen democracy education programs. Mishmar HaChinuch is an activist organization that monitors and advocates for humanistic, liberal, and social education in Israel's state school system. This placement suggests at minimum an ideological alignment, though a formal partnership was not documented.

**Source:** https://mishmarhinuch.com/gefen/

### DSM Law Firm Connection

The executive board of Yesod is controlled by partners of DSM Law firm (Adi Shay and Shlomit Moshe). DSM specializes in administrative law, regulation, and human rights. This creates a tight link between the organization's governance and a specific legal practice.

---

## 9. Values Alignment Table

| Value | Yesod's Position | Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Democratic governance** | Strongly pro | Core mission; survey on democracy fears; anti-overhaul alignment |
| **Judicial independence** | Strongly pro | Steering committee includes former justices, constitutional scholars |
| **Minority rights** | Pro | Programs in Arab sector; Declaration of Independence framing |
| **Transparency** | Mixed | No foreign funding (positive), but sparse public financial reporting |
| **Jewish identity / Zionism** | Neutral-to-liberal | "Jewish and democratic" framing, but emphasis on democratic side |
| **Religious pluralism** | Implied pro | No explicit statements, but secular-liberal leadership |
| **Settlements / occupation** | No position | Not addressed in any materials found |
| **Political neutrality** | Claimed but questionable | Steering committee is uniformly liberal-centrist; no right-wing representation |

---

## 10. Risk Summary and Open Questions

### Key Risks

1. **Financial sustainability:** Primary funder (Moshe Yanai) is bankrupt with $120M+ in debts. Will Yesod survive?
2. **Single-point-of-failure governance:** Executive board controlled by two partners of the same law firm
3. **Scale claims vs. resources:** 76,000 students / 250 schools / 22 authorities -- but only 5 employees? How?
4. **Political one-sidedness:** Steering committee is uniformly liberal. No right-wing, religious, or settler representation. Can the org credibly claim to teach "civic values" to all sectors?

### Open Questions for Further Investigation

1. **What happens to Yesod funding post-Yanai bankruptcy?** Has the org secured alternative donors? Is it in financial distress?
2. **What are the actual Gefen program revenues?** The NIS 1.78M total -- how much comes via Gefen purchases vs. direct donations from Yanai?
3. **GuideStar financial reports:** The full annual financial reports (not available via web scraping due to JS rendering) would show exact revenue breakdown by source. Manual access needed.
4. **Program content review:** The actual lesson plans and curricular materials should be reviewed for ideological framing. Are they genuinely balanced, or do they push a specific political viewpoint under the guise of "civic education"?
5. **The Reichman/Rubinstein connection:** How deep is the institutional relationship? Does Reichman University provide academic legitimacy in exchange for what?
6. **Orly Dein:** Listed as the Gefen contact. What is her full role? Is she the de facto operational leader?
7. **Arab sector programs:** How extensive are they really? Which Arab municipalities participate?
